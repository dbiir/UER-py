1929 or 1989?	1929年还是1989年?
PARIS – As the economic crisis deepens and widens, the world has been searching for historical analogies to help us understand what has been happening.	巴黎-随着经济危机不断加深和蔓延，整个世界一直在寻找历史上的类似事件希望有助于我们了解目前正在发生的情况。
At the start of the crisis, many people likened it to 1982 or 1973, which was reassuring, because both dates refer to classical cyclical downturns.	一开始，很多人把这次危机比作1982年或1973年所发生的情况，这样得类比是令人宽心的，因为这两段时期意味着典型的周期性衰退。
Today, the mood is much grimmer, with references to 1929 and 1931 beginning to abound, even if some governments continue to behave as if the crisis was more classical than exceptional.	如今人们的心情却是沉重多了，许多人开始把这次危机与1929年和1931年相比，即使一些国家政府的表现仍然似乎把视目前的情况为是典型的而看见的衰退。
The tendency is either excessive restraint (Europe) or a diffusion of the effort (the United States).	目前的趋势是，要么是过度的克制（欧洲），要么是努力的扩展（美国）。
Europe is being cautious in the name of avoiding debt and defending the euro, whereas the US has moved on many fronts in order not to waste an ideal opportunity to implement badly needed structural reforms.	欧洲在避免债务和捍卫欧元的名义下正变得谨慎，而美国已经在许多方面行动起来，以利用这一理想的时机来实行急需的结构性改革。
Of course, the fall of the house of Lehman Brothers has nothing to do with the fall of the Berlin Wall.	当然，雷曼兄弟公司的倒闭和柏林墙的倒塌没有任何关系。
Indeed, on the surface it seems to be its perfect antithesis: the collapse of a wall symbolizing oppression and artificial divisions versus the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and reassuring institution of financial capitalism.	事实上，从表面上看，两者似乎是完全是相反的：一个是象征着压抑和人为分裂的柏林墙的倒塌，而另一个是看似坚不可摧的并令人安心的金融资本主义机构的倒塌。
The end of the East-West ideological divide and the end of absolute faith in markets are historical turning points.	东西方意识形态鸿沟的结束，以及对市场绝对信心的后果，都是历史的转折点。
For many of his supporters, it was President Ronald Reagan who, with his deliberate escalation of the arms race, pushed the Soviet economy to the brink, thereby fully demonstrating the superiority of liberal societies and free markets.	对于里根总统的许多的支持者来说，就是他精心策划的军备竞赛的升级，把苏联经济推向了崩溃的边缘，从而充分显示了自由社会和自由市场的优越性。
By contrast, 2009 is likely to pave the way to a new form of bipolarity, but with China substituting for the Soviet Union.	与此相反，2009年很可能会为一种新的两极化形式铺平道路，只是中国取代了苏联。
Everyone seems to be a loser, even if some are more affected than others.	每个人似乎都是输家，即使有些国家比其它国家受到的影响更大。
Yet, history is unfair, and the US, despite its greater responsibility for today’s global crisis, may emerge in better shape than most countries from the morass.	而历史是不公平的。 尽管美国要为当今的全球危机负更大的责任，但美国可能会比大多数国家以更良好的势态走出困境。
In better shape, but not alone.	美国会恢复得更好，但并不是唯一能恢复的国家。
As a visiting professor at Harvard and MIT, I am getting a good preview of what the world could look like when the crisis finally passes.	作为哈佛大学和麻省理工学院的访问教授，我能看到危机过后的世界是什么样子的。
One senses something like the making of an American-Asian dominated universe.	我们能感受到一个美国和亚洲占主导地位的世界正在形成。
From the incredible media lab at MIT to the mathematics and economics departments at Harvard, Asians – Chinese and Indians, in particular – are everywhere, like the Romans in Athens in the first century BC: full of admiration for those from whom they were learning so much, and whom they would overcome in the coming decades.	从一流的麻省理工学院的媒体实验室到哈佛大学的数学和经济系，亚洲人-尤其是中国和印度人-到处都是，犹如公元前一世纪在雅典的罗马人一样：他们对那里学到太多东西的人们充满了敬佩，而他们将在今后几十年打败他们学习的对象。
But before this new order appears, the world may be faced with spreading disorder, if not outright chaos.	但是，在这一新秩序的出现之前，世界可能会面临更广泛的混沌，如果不是彻底的混乱的话。
What, for example, will happen to a country as central and vulnerable as Egypt when hundred of thousands of Egyptians working in the Gulf are forced to return to their homeland as a result of the crisis in the oil-producing countries?	例如，对埃及这样一个重要而又脆弱的国家，有数十万的埃及人曾在海湾工作但现在因石油生产国出现的危机而被迫返回了自己的家园，那埃及会发生什么情况呢？
When the rich get less rich, the poor get poorer.	当富人不再那么富了，穷人就会更穷。
And what about the foreign workers who have reached for the “European dream” and are now faced with potential explosions of xenophobia in Europe’s supposedly open countries?	还有，对于那些追求“欧洲梦”的外来工人，现在他们面临着理应是开放的欧洲国家的仇外心态可能的爆发，他们会有怎样的遭遇？
We can only hope that, in the end, the consequences of 2009 similarly prove to be far less dramatic than we now – intuitively and in our historical reflexes – feel them to be.	我们只能希望2009年的危机同样地最后被证明是远远低于我们现在以直觉和历史回顾的方式��感觉到的那么剧烈。
What Failed in 2008?	2008年败在何处？
BERKELEY – To solve a problem, it is not enough to know what to do.	伯克利—要解决问题，光知道做什么是不够的。
You actually have to implement the solution – and be willing to change course if it turns out that you did not know quite as much as you thought.	你实际上必须实施解决办法——并且在事实证明你知道的并不如你认为的那样多时，你得愿意改变办法。
That is the message of two recent books that, together, tell you everything you need to know about the 2008 financial crisis: what caused it, what can be done to prevent it from recurring, and why those things have yet to be done.	这就是两本新书一起告诉你的信息。 这两本新书讲述了你需要知道的关于2008年金融危机的一切：什么引起了金融危机，可以做什么防止它再次发生，以及为何这些事情还没有人去做。
The first book is The Shifts and the Shocks, by the conservative British journalist Martin Wolf, who begins by cataloguing the major shifts that set the stage for the economic disaster that continues to shape the world today.	第一本书是《变化和冲击》（The Shifts and the Shocks），作者是保守派英国记者马丁·沃尔夫（Martin Wolf）。 在书的开头，他对酝酿了至今仍在影响世界的这场经济灾难的重要变化做了归纳编目。
His starting point is the huge rise in wealth among the world’s richest 0.1% and 0.01% and the consequent pressure for people, governments, and companies to take on increasingly unsustainable levels of debt.	1%和0. 01%人群财富剧增，这给人民、政府和公司造成了日益不可持续的高负债的压力。
Meanwhile, policymakers were lulled into complacency by the widespread acceptance of economic theories such as the “efficient-market hypothesis,” which assumes that investors act rationally and use all available information when making their decisions.	与此同时，决策者因为“有效市场假说”等经济理论的广泛接受而志得意满，有效市场假说认为投资者的行为是理性的，在作出决策时会利用一切可获得的信心。
As a result, markets were deregulated, making it easier to trade assets that were perceived to be safe, but were in fact not.	结果，市场监管被放松，交易被认为安全但实际并不安全的资产变得更加容易。
As a result, systemic risk proliferated beyond central bankers’ wildest imagination.	结果，系统性风险悄然酝酿，并且超过了央行官员最大胆的想象。
Untested – and ultimately incorrect – assumptions created a policymaking environment defined by what can only be called hubris.	未受检验并且最终错误的假设形成了一个只能用狂妄自大形容的决策环境。
Officials underestimated tail risks.	官员低估了尾部风险。
They set inflation targets at around 2% – leaving little room for maneuver when the water got choppy.	它们将通胀目标设定在2%左右——这意味着当波涛汹涌时他们根本没有多少施展空间。
And, most audaciously of all, the European Union introduced the euro as a common currency.	此外，最大胆的动作要数欧盟引入欧元作为共同货币。
Indeed, wrongheaded policymaking continued long after the crisis began.	事实上，方向错误的决策在危机开始后仍然能维持了很长时间。
Politicians responded to worsening economic conditions by hewing as closely as possible to failed prescriptions, making sure to do no more than absolutely necessary to address the biggest economic disaster since the Great Depression.	政客对恶化的经济条件的反应是坚定实施错误的药方，对于这场大萧条以来最严重的经济灾难，他们除了绝对需要做的事情意外什么都不做。
Wolf’s prescription for countering the crisis is simple, smart, and unassailable.	沃尔夫给抵御这场危机开出的药方简单、明智并且无懈可击。
In the short term, he suggests that countries with reserve currencies spend more (especially to finance public-sector investments) and issue more debt.	在短期，他建议拥有储备货币的国家增加支出（特别是公共部门投资融资）、发行更多债务。
Their central banks, he argues, should raise inflation targets to 3% or even 4% per year.	他指出，这些国家的央行应该将通胀目标提高到每年3%甚至4%。
Over the medium term, according to Wolf, countries need to put in place regulatory measures that lower debt levels and discourage overleveraging.	在中期，沃尔夫认为各国需要实施监管措施降低债务水平、阻止过度举债。
The eurozone, too, must resolve its internal contradictions, either by disbanding or by introducing “a minimum set of institutions and policies” that allow the monetary union to function properly.	欧元区也必须解决其内部矛盾，要么通过解散欧元区实现，要么通过引入能令货币联盟正常运行的“最小限度的机构和政策组合”实现。
Wolf’s long-term solutions include tackling inequality, “more global regulation,” a greater degree of “freedom for individual countries to craft their own responses,” and economic analysis that is less in thrall to the free-market ideologues that led us into the crisis in the first place.	沃尔夫的长期解决方案包括遏制不平等、“更加全球化的监管”、更大程度的“个体国家自己决定反应方式的自由”以及更少受到自由市场思想束缚的经济分析。 一开始正是自由市场思想让我们陷入了危机。
And yet, as recommendable as Wolf’s proposals may be, little has been done to implement them.	但是，尽管沃尔夫的方案值得推荐，但几乎没有任何实施。
The reasons why are found in the second book: Hall of Mirrors, by&nbsp;my friend, teacher, and patron, Barry Eichengreen.	原因可以从第二本书中找到：由我的朋友、老师和“老板”巴里·艾肯格林（Barry Eichengreen）所著的《镜厅》（Hall of Mirrors）。
Eichengreen traces our tepid response to the crisis to the triumph of monetarist economists, the disciples of Milton Friedman, over their Keynesian and Minskyite peers – at least when it comes to interpretations of the causes and consequences of the Great Depression.	艾肯格林认为，我们对这场危机反应不温不火，原因要追溯到作为弗里德曼（MiltonFriedman）门徒的���币经济学家对凯恩斯主义和明斯基（MInskyite）主义同行的胜利——至少在解释大萧条的原因和后果方面是如此。
When the 2008 financial crisis erupted, policymakers tried to apply Friedman’s proposed solutions to the Great Depression.	2008年金融危机爆发时，决策者试图使用弗里德曼提出的大萧条方案。
Unfortunately, this turned out to be the wrong thing to do, as the monetarist interpretation of the Great Depression was, to put it bluntly, wrong in significant respects and radically incomplete.	不幸的是，事实证明这是错的，直言不讳地说，货币主义者对大萧条的解释在众多方面都是错误的，并且非常不完整。
The resulting policies were enough to prevent the post-2008 recession from developing into a full-blown depression; but that partial success turned out to be a Pyrrhic victory, for it allowed politicians to declare that the crisis had been overcome, and that it was time to embrace austerity and focus on structural reform.	由此产生的政策足以阻止2008年后的衰退演变为完全的萧条； 但这一局部成功的代价也是巨大的，它让政客宣布危机已经被克服，应该采取紧缩并专注于结构改革。
The result is today’s stagnant economy, marked by anemic growth that threatens to become the new normal.	结果就是现在的经济停滞，其特征是增长无力并且随时可能成为新常态。
The United States and Europe are on track to have thrown away 10% of their potential wealth, while the failure to strengthen financial-sector regulation has left the world economy exposed to the risk of another major crisis.	美国和欧洲损失了10%的潜在财富，而没有强化金融部门监管让世界经济随时可能迎来新一场大危机。
Wolf and Eichengreen would agree that the main shortcomings that led to the 2008 financial crisis – and that continue to underpin our inadequate response to it – are intellectual.	沃尔夫和艾肯格林会认为，导致2008年金融危机的主要缺陷——以及继续破坏我们对危机的不充分反应的主要缺陷——是知识缺陷。
Indeed, the only true lesson of the crisis so far seems to be that its lessons will never truly be learned.	事实上，到目前为止，危机的唯一真正教训是它的教训从未被真正汲取。
A Comeback Strategy for Europe	欧洲的重振战略
STOCKHOLM/MADRID – When Pope Francis addressed the European Parliament last November, he compared the European Union to a grandmother – pleasant and rich with experience, but lacking the vitality and energy of the past.	斯托克霍姆/马德里—去年11月，教皇方济各在其欧洲议会演讲中将欧盟比作祖母——和蔼而富于经验，但已不再有过去的活力和能量。
It is high time, Francis argued, that EU leaders shed their dozy image, recognize the strategic challenges that Europe faces, and forge a clear policy for tackling them.	方济各说，现在是一个关键时刻，欧盟领导人必须摆脱懈怠形象，承认欧洲所面临的战略挑战，并构建应对挑战的明确政策。
Admittedly, the pope’s characterization was alarmingly accurate in some respects.	诚然，教皇的描述在某些角度讲非常准确。
But, despite its seeming lassitude, Europe retains significant strengths.	但是，尽管欧洲看起来疲态尽露，但仍拥有巨大优势。 欧洲是高水平思想和创新的枢纽；
It is a hub of high-level thought and innovation; it is home to some of the world’s most competitive regions and industries; and, perhaps most impressive, it has built a community and market encompassing a half-billion people.	是世界最有竞争力地区和产业的所在地； 最重要的是，它还构建了一个由五亿人组成的社会和市场。
But the world is changing: the Asia-Pacific region is increasingly influencing global developments, economic and otherwise.	但世界正在变化：亚太地区正在日益影响全球经济和其他发展趋势。
The Trans-Pacific Partnership – by which the United States and 11 other countries would create a mega-regional free-trade zone – would most likely accelerate this shift (all the more so if China eventually joins).	跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（Trans-Pacific Partnership，TPP，由美国和其他11国建立的巨型地区自由贸易区）很有可能加速这一变革（如果中国最终也能加入就更加如此了）。
Though the TPP faces no shortage of hurdles to clear before an agreement is finalized, its potential to augment Asia’s economic power cannot be underestimated.	尽管TPP距离最终完成协议还有很多障碍需要跨越，但其扩大亚洲经济实力的潜力绝不容���觑。
Europe must work to secure its position in the new world order – beginning by enhancing its own trade and investment ties with the US.	欧洲必须致力于确保其在新世界秩序中的地位——首先要强化其自身与美国的贸易和投资联系。
The problem is that, as the TPP negotiations progress, talks on the EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) have become so deeply mired in domestic controversies that the entire project may well be scuttled.	在TPP谈判不断推进的同时，欧盟-美国跨大西洋贸易和投资伙伴关系（Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership，TTIP）谈判却深陷国内矛盾的掣肘，整个工程都有可能夭折。
Business leaders on both sides of the Atlantic are convinced that a successful TTIP agreement would bring substantial economic benefits – a perception that many studies reinforce.	大西洋两岸的商业领袖相信，成功的TTIP协议将带来巨大的经济收益——许多研究都强化了这一感觉。
Yet trivial issues – for example, the use of chlorinated chicken and settlements of investor disputes – continue to dominate the debate.	但一些微妙的问题——比如“氯化鸡”（欧洲怀疑美国鸡肉进入市场前都用氯消毒）和投资者纠纷和解等问题——仍主导着争论。
The TTIP’s goal is to unleash the power of the transatlantic economy, which remains by far the world’s largest and wealthiest market, accounting for three-quarters of global financial activity and more than half of world trade.	TTIP的目标是释放跨大西洋经济的力量——目前大西洋两岸仍是世界最大最富有的市场，占全球金融活动的四分之三和世界贸易量的一大半。
(If the TTIP was opened to other economies – such as Turkey, Mexico, and Canada – the benefits would be even greater.)	（如果TTIP向其他经济体开放——比如土耳其、墨西哥和加拿大——则收益还将更大。 ）
Even more compelling than the benefits of achieving an agreement, though, are the potentially catastrophic consequences of failure.	但是，比达成协议的好处更加让人感到必须成功的是谈判失败可能带来的灾难性结果。
For starters, a breakdown of TTIP talks would give considerable ammunition to those in the United Kingdom who advocate withdrawal from the EU; conversely, if the TTIP were implemented, the UK would be unwise – and thus unlikely – to leave.	首先，TTIP谈判的破裂将极大地加强英国鼓吹离开欧盟阵营的力量； 反之，如果TTIP获得实施，英国离开欧盟将是不明智之举，因此也不会发生。
Moreover, the perception that the EU’s internal squabbles had led it to squander a strategic opportunity would probably drive the US to accelerate its disengagement from the continent.	此外，欧洲的内讧导致其白白浪费了一个战略机会，这一感觉可能促使美国加速远离欧洲。
And Russian President Vladimir Putin would invariably regard the EU’s failure as a major opportunity to exert more influence over parts of Europe.	而俄罗斯总统普京也必然会将欧洲的失败视为影响欧洲更多地区的良机。
All of this contributes to a starkly fundamental strategic risk: If the TTIP stalls or collapses, while the TPP moves forward and succeeds, the global balance will tip strongly in Asia’s favor – and Europe will have few options, if any, for regaining its economic and geopolitical influence.	所有这些凸显出一个根本新战略风险：如果TTIP无法取得进展或失败，而TPP取得进展并成功，则全球平衡将朝着极有利于亚洲的方向发展——欧洲极有可能无法重振其经济和地缘政治影响力。
When the TTIP was first proposed, Europe seemed to recognize its value.	TTIP首次提出时，欧洲似乎能够认识到其价值。
Indeed, it was the EU that pushed the US, which initially doubted Europe’s commitment, to launch the negotiation process in June 2013.	事实上，是欧洲推动一开始对欧洲的承诺有所怀疑的美国在2013年6月启动了谈判程序。
The ambition was to complete the negotiations on “one tank of gas.”	当时人们雄心万丈，意图“一鼓作气”完成谈判。
No one wanted to endure protracted talks – or the associated political pain.	没人想让谈判长久拖延——或忍受因此带来的政治痛苦。
But EU leaders essentially abandoned the project, seemingly confirming American fears.	但欧盟领导人在事实上抛弃了这一工程，而这也印证了美国的担心。
Trade negotiators struggled to make headway, while anti-globalization groups seized control of the public discourse, presenting the TTIP as a threat to everything from Europe’s democracy to its health.	贸易谈判在挣扎中前行，而反全球化组织掌握了公共观点的控制权，将TTIP描述为对一切事物的威胁——从欧洲的民主到欧洲的健康莫不如此。
This is dangerously inaccurate talk, and EU leaders must prevent it from gaining any more traction by making the strategic case for the agreement.	这是非常危险的错误言论，欧盟领导人必须拿出推进TTIP的战略性理由，从而阻止这一言论获得更大的市场。
And they must revive their commitment to conclude the talks successfully in 2015.	他们还必须重振2015年成功完成谈判的承诺。
This is not to say that resolving the remaining issues in the TTIP negotiations will be simple.	这并不是说解决TTIP谈判中仍然存在的问题轻而易举。
But establishing a trade agreement, especially one that entails so many regulatory issues, is always difficult, as it must account for the complexity and changeability of modern economies.	但签订贸易协议，特别是包含如此多监管问题的贸易协议，永远不是件容易事，因为它必须考虑到现代经济的复杂性和易变性。
The fact is that the challenges inherent in completing the TTIP are no more intractable than those that EU leaders have faced in the last few years of crisis.	事实上，完成TTIP所包含的挑战并不比欧盟领导人在过去几年的危机中所遇到的挑战更棘手。
When the TTIP negotiations resume next month, EU leaders must push for genuine progress, with the goal of completing a deal by the end of the year.	TTIP谈判将在下个月重启，届时欧盟领导人必须推动真正的进展，并以在年底完成协议为目标。
The good news is that the recent midterm elections in the US might have improved their chances.	好消息是最近的美国中期选举有可能增加他们成功的机会。
President Barack Obama now might get so-called fast-track negotiating authority from Congress.	现在，美国总统奥巴马可能将从国会获得所谓的快速谈判授权。
If he does, Congress would simply approve or reject any negotiated agreement, rather than picking it apart.	果真如此的话，美国国会将对谈成的协议予以批准或否决，而不能束之高阁。
The US presidential election season is starting, and other issues in the new year could easily take over the EU agenda.	美国总统竞选季即将来开帷幕，在新的一年里，其他问题可能轻而易举地取代欧盟日程。
That is why Europe’s leaders have no time to waste.	正因如此，欧洲领导人已无时间可以浪费。
They must seize economic opportunity – and avert strategic disaster.	他们必须抓住经济机会——并避免战略灾难。
The Year That Ended an Epoch?	标志着时代终结的一年？
MADRID – As 2016 comes to an end, the outlook for 2017 is shrouded in uncertainty.	马德里——随着2016年的结束，2017年的前景被不确定性所笼罩。
Tensions in the Middle East are rising, and populist movements have appeared in Europe and the United States.	中东紧张局势正在加剧，欧洲和美国出现了民粹主义运动。
In the Middle East, the tragic conflict in Syria continues, despite several fruitless attempts at rapprochement, which were marred by the fundamental disagreement about Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s future role in any peace process or political transition.	因为对叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德未来在和平进程或政治过渡中所起的作用存在根本性的分歧，在几次修复关系的努力无果而终后，中东的叙利亚悲剧性冲突仍将继续下去。
Meanwhile, over the past week, Syrian government troops, backed by Russia and Iran, have retaken almost all of Aleppo – once Syria’s largest city, now utterly devastated by the war.	此外，过去一周，叙利亚政府军在俄罗斯和伊朗的支持下，已经夺回了几乎整个阿勒颇——阿勒颇曾是叙利亚最大的城市，现在已经彻底毁灭在战火之中。
The world’s priority for the coming year must be to achieve peace in Syria, which will require close regional and international cooperation.	世界各国来年的首要任务必须是通过密切的地区和国际合作来实现叙利亚和平。
On December 27, Iran, Russia, and Turkey will hold a tripartite meeting in Moscow to discuss a political solution for the Syria conflict.	12月27日，伊朗、俄罗斯和土耳其将在莫斯科举行三方会议，探讨政治解决叙利亚冲突。
That meeting, if it takes place, is likely to be overshadowed by the fallout from the assassination of Russia’s ambassador to Turkey.	如果那次会议真的召开，也有可能笼罩在俄罗斯驻土耳其大使被杀的阴影当中。
But it is nothing if not surprising that these parties, and not the US and the European Union, would be negotiating such an agreement.	最出人意料的是居然是俄、伊、土三方，而非美国和欧盟，参与谈判这样的协定。
One positive development this year came in March, when the EU and Turkey signed an agreement to address the refugee crisis.	今年的积极进展出现在3月份，当时欧盟和土耳其就解决难民危机的协议达成。
Turkey has now taken in some three million Syrian refugees since the beginning of the conflict.	从这次冲突开始到现在，土耳其已经接收了约300万叙利亚难民。
Although EU-Turkey relations are currently not at their best, the dialogue between the two sides must continue in 2017, not least because of their common interests, which are based not only on economic interdependence, but also on the refugee crisis and the collective fight against terrorism.	尽管欧盟土耳其关系现在并不在历史高点，但双方必须在2017年继续对话，尤其因为双方拥有基于经济相互依存、难民危机及反恐集体斗争等诸多共同利益。
European politics next year, meanwhile, will be consumed by the Brexit negotiations.	此外，英国退欧谈判将影响明年的欧洲政治。
In March, the United Kingdom will likely invoke Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, triggering the formal procedure for withdrawal from the EU.	英国或将于3月启动《里斯本条约》第五十条，从而触发退出欧盟的正式程序。
The challenge will be to reach an agreement that guarantees the wellbeing of future EU-UK relations.	难点在于就确保未来欧盟-英国关系健康发展达成一致。
This will not be easy, and EU negotiators have already set a timeline of only 18 months.	做到这一点绝非易事。 欧盟谈判人员已经制订了仅有18个月的时间表。
While much remains uncertain, what is clear is that if the UK wants to retain access to the European single market, it will have to accept the EU’s four freedoms, including the free movement of workers.	虽然不确定因素仍然很多，但有一点十分明确，即如果英国想要保留单一市场准入权，就必须接受包括劳动力自由流动在内的欧盟四项自由政策。
In 2017, several European countries will hold general elections, and there is a risk that isolationist, anti-European populist movements will make a strong showing.	有几个欧洲国家将在2017年举行大选，孤立主义者、反欧洲民粹运动或将在此期间表现强势。
For the EU to lose a country as militarily and economically important as the UK is bad enough; but to lose a founding EU member state, such as France, would be tragic.	对欧盟而言，失去像英国这样在军事和经济上都很重要的国家无疑是一种打击； 但失去法国这样的创始成员国或将酿成悲剧性的后果。
Fortunately, many Europeans’ views toward the EU actually improved in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.	幸运的是，许多欧洲人对欧盟的看法事实上在英国退欧公投后有改善的迹象。
But this will not lessen the challenge for EU governments in the year ahead.	但这并不意味着欧盟政府在今后一年所面临的挑战减轻。
They must unite societies divided by powerful global forces, such as globalization and rapid technological innovation.	他们必须重新团结被全球化和快速技术创新等强劲全球势力切割得四分五裂的社会。
The Brexit referendum, followed by Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, signaled the rise of populism in the West.	英国退欧公投、而后是唐纳德·特朗普在美国总统大选中的获胜标志着西方民粹主义势力抬头。
But now that Trump is filling his cabinet with oligarchs and former military men, we have reason to doubt that he will keep his promise to govern without the Washington “establishment.”	但现在，特朗普正在征召寡头和前军人进入其内阁，我们有理由质疑他是否会履行自己摆脱华盛顿“建制派”进行治理的承诺。
Trump’s incoming administration is full of unknowns, but there can be no doubt that his rejection of multilateral institutions will endanger international efforts to cooperate on solutions to the world’s biggest problems.	特朗普即将执政的新内阁充满了未知数，但毫无疑问他对多边机构的抗拒会危及合作解决全球最严重问题的工作。
This holds peril for US-EU relations.	这必将对美国-欧盟关系构成威胁。
In previous years, the Paris climate agreement and the nuclear agreement with Iran were rays of light in a world closing itself off to multilateralism.	过去几年，巴黎气候协议及伊朗核协议曾为这个远离多边主义的世界带来一线曙光。
In the coming years, such rays may become scarcer still.	而在未来几年，这样的曙光会变得越来越稀有。
Now more than ever, we need the kind of dialogue that builds strategic trust between great powers.	现在比以往任何时候都更需要在大国间建立战略互信的对话。
And yet, Trump’s statements casting doubt on continued US adherence to a “One China” policy vis-à-vis Taiwan could severely damage relations between the world’s two largest economies.	而特朗普质疑美国是否将继续坚持“一个中国”政策的声明极有可能严重损害世界两大经济体之间的关系。
Similarly, notwithstanding the pro-Russian leanings of some among Trump’s team, the US-Russian relationship also lacks strategic trust, owing to Russia’s military intervention in Syria, its invasion of eastern Ukraine, and its alleged interference in the US election.	同样，尽管特朗普团队不乏一定程度的亲俄倾向，但因为俄罗斯军事入侵叙利亚、东乌克兰以及干涉美国大选的指控，美俄关系同样缺乏战略互信。
The coming year will be particularly important for Europe.	来年对欧洲而言尤其重要。
Relations between the EU and the US must remain strong, rooted in mutual respect for democracy, freedom, and human rights.	植根于对民主、自由和人权的共同尊重，欧盟和美国之间的关系必须保持稳固。
After a turbulent 2016, and with little positive news in international politics, 2017 is shaping up to be a year of challenges and uncertainty.	在充满动荡的2016年后，因为国际政治中几乎鲜有积极消息，2017年注定充满挑战和不确定性。
But the biggest uncertainty of all is whether this is simply the end of another year, or the end of a geopolitical epoch.	但最大的不确定性却是2016年仅仅是又一年的结束，还是整个地缘政治时代的终结。
Another Slow Year for the Global Economy	全球经济缓慢增长又一年
WASHINGTON, DC – Last April, the International Monetary Fund projected that the world economy would grow by 3.5% in 2015.	华盛顿—去年4月，国际货币基金组织（IMF）预测2015年世界经济将增长3. 5%。
In the ensuing months, that forecast was steadily whittled down, reaching 3.1% in October.	在随后的几个月中，这一预测被逐步调低，10月份时下降到3.
But the IMF continues to insist – as it has, with almost banal predictability, for the last seven years – that next year will be better.	1%。 但IMF仍然坚持——在过去七年中它一贯如此，几乎没有什么预见性可言——明年会更好。
But it is almost certainly wrong yet again.	但几乎可以肯定，IMF又错了。
For starters, world trade is growing at an anemic annual rate of 2%, compared to 8% from 2003 to 2007.	首先，世界贸易年增长率只有区区2%，而2003—2007年间高达8%。
Whereas trade growth during those heady years far exceeded that of world GDP, which averaged 4.5%, lately, trade and GDP growth rates have been about the same.	这几年中，贸易增长远远高于世界GDP（平均增长率为4. 5%），但最近贸易和GDP增长大致相当。
Even if GDP growth outstrips growth in trade this year, it will likely amount to no more than 2.7%.	即使今年GDP增长超过贸易增长，也可能无法超过2. 7%。
The question is why.	问题在于为什么。
According to Christina and David Romer of the University of California, Berkeley, the aftershocks of modern financial crises – that is, since World War II – fade after 2-3 years.	据加州大学伯克利分校的克里斯蒂娜和大卫·罗默（Christina and David Romer），现代金融危机（二战后）的余波会持续2—3年时间才会消失。
The Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff say that it takes five years for a country to dig itself out of a financial crisis.	哈佛大学经济学家卡门·莱因哈特（Carmen Reinhart）和肯尼斯·罗格夫（Kenneth Rogoff）说，一国需要五年时间才能从金融危机中走出。
And, indeed, the financial dislocations of 2007-2008 have largely receded.	而事实上，2007—2008年的金融动荡已经基本消失。
So what accounts for the sluggish economic recovery?	因此，是什么导致了经济复苏滞后？
One popular explanation lies in the fuzzy notion of “secular stagnation”: long-term depressed demand for goods and services is undermining incentives to invest and hire.	一个流行的解释是一个叫作“长期停滞”的模糊概念——长期受到抑制的商品和服务需求破坏了投资和招聘激励。
But demand would remain weak only if people lacked confidence in the future.	但需求只有在人们对未来信心不足时才会持续低迷。
The only logical explanation for this enduring lack of confidence, as Northwestern University’s Robert Gordon has painstakingly documented and argued, is slow productivity growth.	这一信心持续缺失的唯一符合逻辑的解释，正如西北大学的罗伯特·戈登（Robert Gordon）费煞苦心地记录和论证的，是生产率增长缓慢。
Before the crisis – and especially from 2003 to 2007 – slow productivity growth was being obscured by an illusory sense of prosperity in much of the world.	危机前，特别是2003—2007年，生产率增长缓慢被一种世界大部分国家都在欣欣向荣的幻觉所蒙蔽。
In some countries – notably, the United States, Spain, and Ireland – rising real-estate prices, speculative construction, and financial risk-taking were mutually reinforcing.	在一些国家——特别是美国、西班牙和爱尔兰——高升的放假、投机性建设和金融冒险互相强化。
At the same time, countries were amplifying one another’s growth through trade.	与此同时，各国通过贸易放大彼此的增长。
Central to the global boom was China, the rising giant that flooded the world with cheap exports, putting a lid on global inflation.	这场全球繁荣的核心是中国，这个崛起的巨无霸向全世界输出廉价出口品，遏制了全球通胀。
Equally important, China imported a huge volume of commodities, thereby bolstering many African and Latin American economies, and purchased German cars and machines, enabling Europe’s largest economy to keep its regional supply chains humming.	同样重要的是，中国进口了巨量大宗商品，从而提振了许多非洲和拉丁美洲经济体； 还购买了大量德国汽车和机器，让欧洲最大经济体保持其地区供应链满负荷运行。
This dynamic reversed around March 2008, when the US rescued its fifth-largest investment bank, Bear Sterns, from collapse.	这一动态在2008年3月左右发生了逆转。 当时，美国拯救了其第五大投资银行贝尔斯登，使其免于破产。
With the eurozone banks also deeply implicated in the subprime mortgage mess and desperately short of US dollars, America and much of Europe began a remorseless slide into recession.	欧元区银行业深陷次贷乱局，急缺美元，因此美国和欧洲的大部开始滑向衰退。
Whereas in the boom years, world trade had spread the bounty, it was now spreading the malaise.	在繁荣年份，世界贸易传播着财富，而如今，世界贸易传播着经济萎靡。
As each country’s GDP growth slowed, so did its imports, causing its trading partners’ growth to slow as well.	随着各国GDP增长的放缓，进口也开始放缓，贸易伙伴的增长也随之放缓。
The US economy began to emerge from its recession in the second half of 2009, thanks largely to aggressive monetary policy and steps to stabilize the financial system.	美国经济从2009年下半年开始走出衰退，这主要是为稳定金融体系而采取的激进货币政策和措施的功劳。
Eurozone policymakers, by contrast, rejected monetary stimulus and implemented fiscal austerity measures, while ignoring the deepening distress of their banks.	相反，欧洲决策者拒绝采取货币刺激而实施了财政紧缩，无视其银行压力的加剧。
The eurozone thus pushed the world into a second global recession.	于是，欧元区将世界拖入了第二场全球衰退。
Just when that recession seemed to have run its course, emerging economies began to unravel.	而正当这场衰退眼看就要痊愈时，新兴经济体开始崩溃。
For years, observers had been touting the governance and growth-enhancing reforms that these countries’ leaders had supposedly introduced.	多年来，观察家们一直在鼓吹这些国家领导人如何如何实施治理和刺激增长的改革。
In October 2012, the IMF celebrated emerging economies’ “resilience.”	2012年10月，IMF大大赞扬了新兴经济体的“恢复力”。
As if on cue, that facade began to crumble, revealing an inconvenient truth: factors like high commodity prices and massive capital inflows had been concealing serious economic weaknesses, while legitimizing a culture of garish inequality and rampant corruption.	恰逢此时，门面撑不住了，暴露出一个令人不快的事实：大宗商品价格高企和大规模资本流入等因素掩盖了严重的经济弱点，也让剧烈的不平等性和无孔不入的腐败成为合法的文化。
These problems are now being compounded by the growth slowdown in China, the fulcrum of global trade.	如今，这些问题因为全球贸易的支柱——中国增长放缓而雪上加霜。 而最坏的时刻还没有到来。
And the worst is yet to come.	中国巨大的工业过剩产能和房地产过剩还没有消化；
China’s huge industrial overcapacity and property glut needs to be wound down; the hubris driving its global acquisitions must be reined in; and its corruption networks have to be dismantled.	推动其全球兼并的傲慢必须得到遏制； 其腐败网络也必须打破。
In short, the factors that dragged down the global economy in 2015 will persist – and in some cases even intensify – in the new year.	简言之，2015年拖累全球经济的因素在新的一年里还会持续——有的甚至还会加剧。
Emerging economies will remain weak.	新兴经济体将继续疲软。
The eurozone, having enjoyed a temporary reprieve from austerity, will be constrained by listless global trade.	暂时摆脱了紧缩的欧元区将受到全球贸易萎靡的束缚。
Rising interest rates on corporate bonds portend slower growth in the US.	公司债券利率的提高预示美国增长减速。
China’s collapsing asset values could trigger financial turbulence.	中国资产价值崩盘可能引发金融动荡。
And policymakers are adrift, with little political leverage to stem these trends.	而决策者就像是无根之木，没有政治手段来遏制这些趋势。
The IMF should stop forecasting renewed growth and issue a warning that the global economy will remain weak and vulnerable unless world leaders act energetically to spur innovation and growth.	IMF应该停止更新增长预测，而是发布警告：全球经济将继续保持萎靡和脆弱，除非世界领导人着力刺激创新和增长。
Such an effort is long overdue.	这样的措施早就应该实行了。
Trumpian Uncertainty	特朗普的不确定性
NEW YORK – Every January, I try to craft a forecast for the coming year.	发自纽约——每年一月，我都会尝试对未来一年作出预测。
Economic forecasting is notoriously difficult; but, notwithstanding the truth expressed in Harry Truman’s request for a one-armed economist (who wouldn’t be able to say “on the other hand”), my record has been credible.	经济预测是件极为困难的事情； 以至于哈里·杜鲁门总统（Harry Truman）曾要求手下给他找一位独臂经济学家——这样此人就无法模棱两可地说“另一方面（on the other hand）”了——但一直以来我的预测还是靠谱的。
In recent years, I correctly foresaw that, in the absence of stronger fiscal stimulus (which was not forthcoming in either Europe or the United States), recovery from the Great Recession of 2008 would be slow.	这几年来我正确地预见到，在缺乏更强有力财政刺激政策（在欧洲或美国都一样）的情况下，2008年大衰退的复苏进程将较为缓慢。
In making these forecasts, I have relied more on analysis of underlying economic forces than on complex econometric models.	同时我的预测更多地依赖于对基本经济力量的分析，而非复杂的经济计量模型。
For example, at the beginning of 2016, it seemed clear that the deficiencies of global aggregate demand that have been manifest for the last several years were unlikely to change dramatically.	例如在2016年初，很显然在过去几年中呈现的全球总需求不足将不大可能出现巨大改变。
Thus, I thought that forecasters of a stronger recovery were looking at the world through rose-tinted glasses. Economic developments unfolded much as I anticipated.	因此我认为那些相信会实现强劲复苏的预测者是过于乐观了，最终实际的经济发展也与我的预测一致。
Not so the political events of 2016.	2016年的政治事件也是如此。
I had been writing for years that unless growing inequality – especially in the US, but also in many countries throughout the world – was addressed, there would be political consequences.	多年来我一直指出，除非在全球许多国家（尤其是美国）日益严重的不平等问题得到解决，否则必将产生某些政治后果。
But inequality continued to worsen – with striking data showing that average life expectancy in the US was on the decline.	但不平等状况依然持续恶化——令人震惊的数据显示，美国的预期平均寿命正在下降。
These results were foreshadowed by a study last year, by Anne Case and Angus Deaton, which showed that life expectancy was on the decline for large segments of the population – including America’s so-called angry men of the Rust Belt.	正如安娜·凯斯（Anne Case）和安格斯·迪顿（Angus Deaton）的一项研究表明：美国大部分人口的预期寿命都在下降，包括所谓北部老工业区的愤怒居民们。
But, with the incomes of the bottom 90% having stagnated for close to a third of a century (and declining for a significant proportion), the health data simply confirmed that things were not going well for very large swaths of the country.	而由于90％的底层人士收入增长已经停滞了将近1/3个世纪（且其中很大比例都出现了下滑），医疗数据清晰明白地证实了美国大部分地区处境不妙。
And while America might be at the extreme of this trend, things were little better elsewhere.	但美国可能处于这种趋势的极端，其他地方的情况会好一点。
But, if it seemed clear that there would be political consequences, their form and timing were far less obvious.	但如果这似乎必然预示着某些政治后果，那么其形式和时间就不那么明显了。
Why did the backlash in the US come just when the economy seemed to be on the mend, rather than earlier?	为什么美国的下行会在经济恢复期出现，而不是更为提前？
And why did it manifest itself in a lurch to the right?	为何这会表现为政治右倾？
After all, it was the Republicans who had blocked assistance to those losing their jobs as a result of the globalization they pushed assiduously. It was the Republicans who, in 26 states, refused to allow the expansion of Medicaid, thereby denying health insurance to those at the bottom.	毕竟正是共和党人拒绝援助那些因他们全力推动全球化而失业的人们，是共和党人否决在26个州扩大医疗补助，从而拒绝为底层的人提供医疗保险。
And why was the victor somebody who made his living from taking advantage of others, openly admitted not paying his fair share of taxes, and made tax avoidance a point of pride?	为什么一个依靠占他人便宜来谋生，公开承认并未支付合理份额税收，并以避税为荣的人会成为大选最终赢家？
Donald Trump grasped the spirit of the time: things weren’t going well, and many voters wanted change.	唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）抓住了时代精神：境况不佳，许多选民都想来点改变。
Now they will get it: there will be no business as usual. But seldom has there been more uncertainty.	但如今他们会意识到真相：再也没有什么常态可言，但也不会存在更多的不确定性。
Which policies Trump will pursue remains unknown, to say nothing of which will succeed or what the consequences will be.	特朗普将实施何种政策仍然是未知之数，更遑论哪些政策将会成功或者后果将是什么了。
Trump seems hell-bent on having a trade war.	特朗普似乎拼命想发起一场贸易战。
But how will China and Mexico respond?	那么中国和墨西哥将如何应对？
Trump may well understand that what he proposes will violate World Trade Organization rules, but he may also know that it will take a long time for the WTO to rule against him.	特朗普清楚知道他的提议会违反世贸规则，但他估计也明白世贸组织需要很长时间来推翻这一做法。
And by then, America’s trade account may have been rebalanced.	到那时候美国的贸易账户可能早就实现重新平衡了。
But two can play that game: China can take similar actions, though its response is likely to be more subtle.	但这个博弈可是双方面的：中国也可以采取类似但更为隐秘微妙的行动。
If a trade war were to break out, what would happen?	那么如果真爆发一场贸易战的话，将会出现何种状况？
Trump may have reason to think he could win; after all, China is more dependent on exports to the US than the US is on exports to China, which gives the US an advantage.	特朗普可能觉得自己有把握能赢； 毕竟中国对向美国出口的依赖要强于美国对中国出口，这是美国的优势。
But a trade war is not a zero-sum game. The US stands to lose as well.	但贸易战可不是一场此消彼长的零和游戏，美国也会输。
And the Chinese may be in a better position to respond to US attempts to inflict pain on them than the US is to respond to the pain that China might inflict on Americans.	而中国人可能比美国人处于更有利的地位来应对对方施加的危机。
It’s anybody’s guess who can stand the pain better.	大家都在猜测谁的承受能力更强：是普通民众在泥潭里长期挣扎的美国？
Will it be the US, where ordinary citizens have already suffered for so long, or China, which, despite troubled times, has managed to generate growth in excess of 6%?	还是即便在困难时期也得以实现超过6％增长的中国？
More broadly, the Republican/Trump agenda, with its tax cuts even more weighted toward the rich than the standard GOP recipe would imply, is based on the idea of trickle-down prosperity – a continuation of the Reagan era’s supply-side economics, which never actually worked.	更宏观地看来，共和党/特朗普的议程——其税收削减甚至比标准的共和党方案更为偏袒富人——意味着这些政策都是基于涓滴繁荣（富人多赚钱消费从而穷人有工作）的理念，也是里根时代供给侧经济学政策的延续——但这一政策从未奏效过。
Fire-breathing rhetoric, or raving three a.m. tweets, may assuage the anger of those left behind by the Reagan revolution, at least for a while.	惹火的言论或者半夜三点在推特上发表的胡言乱语至少能在一段时间内安抚那些被里根革命所抛弃的愤世者。
But for how long?	但这能维持要多久呢？
And what happens then?	随后又会是何种状况？
Trump might like to repeal the ordinary laws of economics, as he goes about his version of voodoo economics. But he can’t.	特朗普可能喜欢颠覆常规的经济学法则，因为他乐于奉行自己那一套巫术经济学，但这是行不通的。
Still, as the world’s largest economy leads the way into uncharted political waters in 2017 and beyond, it would be foolhardy for a mere mortal to attempt a forecast, other than to state the obvious: the waters will almost certainly be choppy, and many – if not most – pundit ships will sink along the way.	而随着美国这个全球最大经济体在2017年及以后的年月进入一片未知的政治水域，除了指出一些显而易见的事实之外，任何人类的预测都是不智的：这片水域几乎肯定会激起风浪，而许多——如果不是大多数——预测专家的航船也将随之倾覆沉没。
9/11 and the New Authoritarianism	9/11和新独裁专制主义
Five years after the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, “9/11” is no longer a mere date.	袭击纽约双子塔和华盛顿五角大楼五年后，“9/11”已经不再仅仅是一个日期了。
It has entered the history books as the beginning of something new, a new era perhaps, but in any case a time of change.	它已经作为一个变革时代的某种开端或者是一个新的时代的开始而载入史册。
The terrorist bombings in Madrid and London and elsewhere will also be remembered; but it is “9/11” that has become the catchphrase, almost like “August 1914.”	恐怖分子在马德里和伦敦以及其他地方制造的爆炸事件也将被人铭记； 但是，只有“9/11”几乎像“1914年8月”那样成为了流行语。
But was it really a war that started on September 11, 2001?	但是，那果真是一场开于2001年9月11日的战争吗？
Not all are happy about this American notion.	并不是所有人都赞同这一美国式的观点。
During the heyday of Irish terrorism in the UK, successive British governments went out of their way not to concede to the IRA the notion that a war was being waged.	当爱尔兰恐怖主义在英国猖獗之际，各届英国政府都竭力不屈从于爱尔兰共和军的观点，即正在进行一场战争。
“War” would have meant acceptance of the terrorists as legitimate enemies, in a sense as equals in a bloody contest for which there are accepted rules of engagement.	“战争”将会意味着把恐怖分子接受为合法的敌人，其含义与具有认同的交战规则的一场血腥战争的对等体相同。
This is neither a correct description nor a useful terminology for terrorist acts, which are more correctly described as criminal.	这既非对恐怖主义行为的正确描述，也不是有用的词汇。 恐怖分子应该更为准确地被称为罪犯。
By calling them war – and naming an opponent, usually al-Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden – the United States government has justified domestic changes that, before the 9/11 attacks, would have been unacceptable in any free country.	但是通过称之为战争、并把基地组织及其领导人本拉登点名为对手，美国政府给某些国内变化提供了理由。 这些国内变化在9/11袭击之前是不会被任何自由国家所接受的。
Most of these changes were embodied in the so-called “USA Patriot Act.”	这些变化的大多数都体现在所谓的“美国爱国者法案”上。
Though some of the changes simply involved administrative regulations, the Patriot Act’s overall effect was to erode the great pillars of liberty, such as habeas corpus , the right to recourse to an independent court whenever the state deprives an individual of his freedom.	尽管某些变化仅仅涉及到行政规定，但是，爱国者法案的整体效果却是侵蚀自由的支柱，例如人身保护，也就是无论何时国家剥夺个人自由，均有向独立法院寻求救助的权利。
From an early date, the prison camp at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba became the symbol of something unheard of: the arrest without trial of “illegal combatants” who are deprived of all human rights.	很久以来，古巴关塔那摩湾的战俘营成为了闻所未闻的象征，也就是不经审判逮捕被剥夺所有人权的“非法战斗人员”。
The world now wonders how many more of these non-human humans are there in how many places.	如今，世界并不知道在多少地方还有多少更多的遭受非人待遇的人。
For everyone else, a kind of state of emergency was proclaimed that has allowed state interference in essential civil rights.	对于其他所有人而言，好像是宣布了某种紧急状态，允许国家干涉基本民权。
Controls at borders have become an ordeal for many, and police persecution now burdens quite a few.	边境检查已经成为许多人的煎熬，警察起诉给很多人带来了负担。
A climate of fear has made life hard for anyone who looks suspicious or acts suspiciously, notably for Muslims.	一种恐惧的气候让任何看似可疑或者行为可疑的人、特别是穆斯林生活困难。
Such restrictions on freedom did not meet with much public opposition when they were adopted.	当采取这些限制自由的措施的时候并没有遇到很多公众的反对。
On the contrary, by and large it was the critics, not the supporters, of these measures who found themselves in trouble.	相反，总体而言，那些措施的批评者，而非支持者发现遇到了麻烦。
In Britain, where Prime Minister Tony Blair supported the US attitude entirely, the government introduced similar measures and even offered a new theory.	在英国，布莱尔首相全力支持美国的态度，政府引入了类似的措施，甚至提出了一个新的理论。
Blair was the first to argue that security is the first freedom.	布莱尔第一个主张安全是第一自由。
In other words, liberty is not the right of individuals to define their own lives, but the right of the state to restrict individual freedom in the name of a security that only the state can define.	换言之，自由并非是个人确定自身生活的权利，而是国家以安全的名义限制个人自由的权利。 只有国家才能确定安全的含义。
This is the beginning of a new authoritarianism.	这就是一个新的独裁主义的开始。
The problem exists in all countries affected by the threat of terrorism, though in many it has not become quite as specific.	这一问题存在于所有受到恐怖主义威胁的国家，尽管在许多国家中这已经变得非常具体。
In most countries of continental Europe, “9/11” has remained an American date.	在大多数欧洲大陆国家，”9/11“已经成为一个美国人的日子。
There is even a debate – and indeed some evidence – concerning the question of whether involvement in the “war against terrorism” has actually increased the threat of terrorist acts.	甚至还有人辩论，而且确实还有证据表明，参与到“反恐战争”之中是否实际上增加了恐怖主义行动的威胁。
Germans certainly use this argument to stay out of the action wherever possible.	德国人当然在可能的情况下利用这一论点置身度外。
This stance, however, has not prevented the spread of something for which a German word is used in other languages, too: Angst .	但是，这一立场并没有防止德语中所说的忧虑的扩散。
A diffuse anxiety is gaining ground.	一种弥散性的焦虑正在扩大。
People feel uneasy and worried, especially when traveling.	人们感到不安，特别是在旅行的时候。
Any train accident or airplane crash is now at first suspected of being an act of terrorism.	任何一个火车事故或者飞机坠毁现在都首先被怀疑是恐怖主义行为。
Thus, 9/11 has meant, directly or indirectly, a great shock, both psychologically and to our political systems.	这样，9/11已经直接或间接地意味着一个巨大的震惊事件，在心理上以及对于政治体系而言都是如此。
While terrorism is fought in the name of democracy, the fight has in fact led to a distinct weakening of democracy, owing to official legislation and popular angst.	尽管以民主的名义与恐怖主义作战，实际上这一斗争由于官方的立法以及民众的忧虑而已经导致对民主明显的削弱。
One of the worrying features of the 9/11 attacks is that it is hard to see their purpose beyond the perpetrators’ resentment of the West and its ways.	9/11攻击的令人担忧的特性之一就是除了罪犯们仇恨西方及其生活方式之外，很难看到他们的目的。
But the West’s key features, democracy and the rule of law, have taken a far more severe battering at the hands of their defenders than by their attackers.	但是西方社会的主要特征，即民主和法治却已经在捍卫者手中遭到了严重的损害，其程度超过远远超过其攻击者。
Two steps, above all, are needed to restore confidence in liberty within the democracies affected by the legacy of 9/11.	最重要的是，需要采取两个步骤来在受到9/11后果影响的��主国家恢复对自由的信心。
First, we must make certain that the relevant legislation to meet the challenge of terrorism is strictly temporary.	首先，我们必须确保应对恐怖主义挑战的相关立法是严格具有时限的。
Some of today’s restrictions on habeas corpus and civil liberties have sunset clauses restricting their validity; all such rules should be re-examined by parliaments regularly.	当今的某些对人身自由以及民权的限制含有限制其时效的废止条款。 所有这些法规都应当定期接受议会的重新审查。
Second, and more importantly, our leaders must seek to calm, rather than exploit, public anxiety.	第二，也是更为重要的是，我们的领导人应当力求平息、而不是利用公众的焦虑。
The terrorists with whom we are currently at “war” cannot win, because their dark vision will never gain broad popular legitimacy.	我们目前“交战”的恐怖分子无法获胜，因为他们的黑暗的观点永远不会赢得广泛的公众合法认可。
That is all the more reason for democrats to stand tall in defending our values – first and foremost by acting in accordance with them.	这也就是民主派人士应当身先士卒、首要地以遵循我们的价值观的方式来捍卫它们的原因。
9/11 in Perspective	9·11：十年后的盘点
NEW YORK – It was a decade ago that 19 terrorists took control of four planes, flew two into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, hit the Pentagon with a third, and crashed the fourth in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers resisted and made it impossible for the terrorists to complete their malevolent mission.	纽约——十年前，19名恐怖分子劫持了四架民航客机，其中两架撞上世贸中心双子塔，第三架撞击了五角大楼，第四架在乘客的反抗下无法完成袭击，坠毁于宾夕法尼亚旷野。
In a matter of hours, more than 3,000 innocent people, mostly Americans, but also people from 115 other countries, had their lives suddenly and violently taken from them.	只不过几个小时，3000多无辜平民被突如其来的暴行夺去了生命，其中大多是美国人，但也有来自其他115个国家的人。
September 11, 2001, was a terrible tragedy by any measure, but it was not a historical turning point.	2001年9月11日，以任何标准看都是一个可怕的惨剧，但它并非一个历史转折点。
It did not herald a new era of international relations in which terrorists with a global agenda prevailed, or in which such spectacular terrorist attacks became commonplace. On the contrary, 9/11 has not been replicated.	它并未开启一个由全球恐怖主义主导国际关系的新时代，类似的大规模恐怖袭击也没有变成家常便饭。
Despite the attention devoted to the “Global War on Terrorism,” the most important developments of the last ten years have been the introduction and spread of innovative information technologies, globalization, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the political upheavals in the Middle East.	虽然人们在“全球反恐战争”上投注了大量精力，但是过去10年最重要的进展是信息技术的创新与传播、全球化、伊拉克与阿富汗战争以及中东的政治动荡。
As for the future, it is much more likely to be defined by the United States’ need to put its economic house in order; China’s trajectory within and beyond its borders; and the ability of the world’s governments to cooperate on restoring economic growth, stemming the spread of nuclear weapons, and meeting energy and environmental challenges.	未来一个阶段的关键，则是美国整修其经济大厦的努力，中国在国内国际事务中的走向，各国政府在重振经济增长、控制核扩散以及应对能源与环境挑战方面的合作能力。
It is and would be wrong to make opposition to terrorism the centerpiece of what responsible governments do in the world.	如果把反对恐怖主义当成负责任的政府在世界上的核心要务，这是错误的。
Terrorists continue to be outliers with limited appeal at best.	恐怖主义仍是边缘角色，它们的吸引力终归是有限的。
They can destroy but not create.	它们只破坏，不建设。
It is worth noting that the people who went into the streets of Cairo and Damascus calling for change were not shouting the slogans of Al Qaeda or supporting its agenda.	值得注意的是，人们走上开罗和大马士革街头，呼喊的并不是基地组织的口号，也没有对它的纲领表示支持。
Moreover, measures have been implemented to push back, successfully, against terrorists.	此外，种种措施已经成功地令恐怖分子退入守势。
Intelligence assets have been redirected. Borders have been made more secure and societies more resilient.	情报资源已重新配置，国境线已变得更安全，社会已变得更有弹性。
International cooperation has increased markedly, in part because governments that cannot agree on many things can agree on the need to cooperate in this area.	反恐国际合作显著增强，部分是因为，各国政府都觉得需要在这一领域加强合作，尽管它们在其他领域颇有分歧。
Military force has played a role as well.	军事力量也扮演着某种角色。
Al Qaeda lost its base in Afghanistan when the Taliban government that had provided it sanctuary was ousted from power.	基地组织丧失了位于阿富汗的巢穴，正式因为向它提供庇护的塔利班政府被推翻。
Osama bin-Laden was finally found and killed by US Special Forces in the suburbs of Islamabad.	奥萨马·本·拉登最终被美国特种部队找到并击毙。
Drones – unmanned aircraft that are remotely steered – have proven to be effective in killing a significant number of terrorists, including many of the most important leaders.	军事无人机在击毙恐怖组织头目的行动中作用非凡。
Weak governments can be made stronger; governments that tolerate or support terrorism must be held accountable.	软弱的政府可以得到加强，纵容乃至支持恐怖主义的政府则必须为此负责。
But progress is not to be confused with victory.	但进展不应被称作胜利。
Terrorists and terrorism cannot be eliminated any more than we can rid the world of disease.	恐怖分子和恐怖主义不可能根除，就像我们不可能从地球上消灭疾病一样。
There will always be those who will resort to force against innocent men, women, and children in pursuit of political goals.	总会有人试图对无辜者动用武力以追求其政治目标，不论是对男人、妇女还是儿童。
Indeed, terrorists are advancing in some areas.	事实上，恐怖分子在某些领域走在了前头。
Pakistan remains a sanctuary for Al Qaeda and some of the world’s other most dangerous terrorists.	巴基斯坦仍在为基地组织和世界上其他一些最危险的恐怖分子提供庇护所。
A mixture of instability, government weakness, and ideology in countries such as Yemen, Libya, Somalia, and Nigeria are providing fertile territory for terrorists to organize, train, and mount operations – much as they did in Afghanistan did a decade ago.	由于局势动荡、政府软弱和意识形态等等原因，也门、利比亚、索马里和尼日利亚也在沦为恐怖主义滋生的沃土，它们在那些地方组织、训练、实施行动，就像在十年前的阿富汗一样。
New groups constantly emerge from the ruins of old ones.	旧的组织刚被摧毁，新的组织就冒出头来。
There is also a growing danger of homegrown terrorism.	本土恐怖主义的危险也在增长。
We have seen it in Great Britain and the US.	我们在英国和美国都看到了这种迹象。
The Internet, one of the great inventions of the modern Western world, has shown itself to be a weapon that can be used to incite and train those who wish to cause harm to that world.	互联网，这一现代西方世界的伟大发明，也被当成武器，激励并训练那些试图危害这个世界的人。
The question raised in October 2003 by then US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is no less relevant today: “Are we capturing, killing, or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting, training, and deploying against us?”	2003年10月，时任美国国防部长拉姆斯菲尔德曾提出一个问题，至今仍很中肯：“我们每天俘虏、击毙、关押和改造过来的恐怖分子，能比伊斯兰学校和激进宗教人士每天招募、训练和派遣出来反对我们的人数多吗？
All things being equal, we probably are.	”如果将一切等量齐观，那我们也许已经做到了。
But even small terrorist successes are costly in terms of lives, money, and making open societies less so.	但恐怖分子的任何一点微小成功，对开放社会都意味着高昂的生命和金钱成本，从这个意义上说，我��得不偿失。
What is to be done?	那我们该怎么办？
Alas, there is no single or silver bullet.	可惜没有一蹴而就的办法。
The establishment of a Palestinian state will not be enough for those terrorists who want to see the elimination of the Jewish state, any more than reaching a compromise over Kashmir will satisfy those Pakistan-based terrorists with bigger agendas vis-à-vis India.	巴勒斯坦建国还是不够，因为恐怖分子想要消灭犹太人的国家； 在克什米尔问题上达成妥协，也无法满足巴基斯坦恐怖分子对印度更大的领土要求。
Reducing unemployment is desirable, of course, but many terrorists do not come from poverty.	减少失业当然是件好事，但许多恐怖分子并非穷人出身。
Helping to make societies in the Middle East and elsewhere more democratic might reduce the alienation that can lead to radicalism and worse, but this is easier said than done.	帮助中东和其他地方的社会变得更民主有助于缓解边缘化作用，遏制极端主义，但这说起来比做起来容易。
Of course, we want to continue to find ways to make ourselves less vulnerable and terrorists more so.	当然，我们需要继续想办法，让我们变强，让恐怖分子变弱。
But what may be most important, particularly in the Arab and Islamic communities, is to end any acceptance of terrorism.	但最重要的是阻止恐怖主义以任何方式进行传播，尤其是在阿拉伯和伊斯兰社会。
The Nigerian father who warned the US embassy in Lagos that he feared what his own son might do – before that same young man attempted to detonate a bomb aboard a flight to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 – is an example of just this.	2009年圣诞节，尼日利亚的一位父亲向美国驻拉各斯大使馆警告说，他担心他的儿子会做出可怕的事情来，从而阻止了后者在飞往底特律的航班上引爆一枚炸弹，这就是一个很好的例子。
Only when more parents, teachers, and community leaders behave likewise will recruitment of terrorists dry up and law-enforcement authorities receive full cooperation from the populations they police.	只有当更多的父母、教师和社会领袖以这样的方式行动起来，才能令恐怖分子的来源枯竭，执法部门才能获得民众的全力配合。
Terrorism must lose its legitimacy among those who have historically supported or tolerated it before it will lose its potency.	在那些传统上支持或纵容恐怖主义的地方，恐怖主义必须先丧失其合法性，才会进一步丧失能量。
Transatlantic Trade for All	所有人的跨大西洋贸易
WASHINGTON, DC – The negotiations to create a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the European Union and the United States are being widely welcomed.	华盛顿—欧盟和美国之间关于成立跨大西洋贸易和投资合作伙伴（TTIP）的谈判受到了广泛的欢迎。
British Prime Minister David Cameron has called the TTIP a “once-in-a-generation prize,” citing potential gains of £80 billion ($125.5 billion) each for the EU and the US and £85 billion for the rest of the world.	英国首相卡梅伦将TTIP称为“一代人只有一次的机会”，认为它将给欧盟和美国各带来800亿英镑的潜在收益，给世界其他地区带来850亿英镑的潜在收益。
For a world weary of waiting for the World Trade Organization’s interminable Doha trade round to conclude, even a bilateral trade initiative may seem like a boon, especially when, as a recent Financial Times editorial pointed out, “bilateral” covers half of the world’s economy.	对于一个等待世贸组织冗长的多哈回合最后结果已经不耐烦的世界来说，即使是双边计划也像是天降恩惠，特别是在《金融时报》最近所指出的“双边”关系包括了世界经济半壁江山的当下。
But there is a serious downside: The deal could hurt developing-country exporters, unless the EU and the US make a concerted effort to protect these actors’ interests.	但风险也是巨大的：TTIP协议可能伤害发展中国家的出口，除非欧盟和美国携手保护这些行动方的利益。
The feature of the proposed pact that elicits the most excitement – its focus on regulatory barriers like mandatory product standards – should actually incite the greatest concern.	计划中的契约引起最多兴奋情绪的部分——其对强制性产品标准等监管壁垒的强调——实际上最应该引起关注。
Given low tariffs in the EU and the US – less than 5%, on average – further preferential reductions will not seriously handicap outsiders.	欧盟和美国关税很低——平均不到5%——因此进一步的优惠降税并不会严重影响其他国家。
But, when it comes to standards – such as those governing safety, health, and the environment – the market-access requirements are brutal and binary: either you meet the established standard or you do not sell.	但是，在标准问题上——比如涉及安全、健康和环境的标准——市场准入标准是严酷且二分的：要么满足规定的标准，要么别来这里卖东西。
As a result, third-country firms’ options will depend on how TTIP standards are established: through harmonization (adoption of a common standard) or mutual recognition (acceptance of goods that meet one another’s established standards).	其结果是第三国企业的选择将取决于TTIP标准如何设置：通过协调（采取共同标准）还是通过互相承认（接受满足彼此规定标准的商品和服务）。
The first option would enable producers everywhere to take advantage of economies of scale.	第一种选择将让世界各地的生产者都能够利用规模经济的优势。
But, in some cases, the harmonized standard could be more stringent than some countries’ original standards.	但是，在一些场合，协调后的标准���能比某些国家原先的标准更加苛刻。
Even though new standards would apply to suppliers from all exporting countries, compliance costs usually vary, meaning that those less equipped to meet higher standards could suffer.	尽管新标准将适用于所有出口国供应商，但合规成本通常各不相同，这意味着更难以满足高标准的企业会遭受损失。
In the late 1990’s, when the EU decided to harmonize standards for aflatoxins (a group of toxic compounds produced by certain molds), eight member states – including Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain – raised their national standards substantially, which is likely to have caused African exports of cereals, dried fruits, and nuts to Europe to decline by as much as $670 million.	20世纪90年代末，欧盟决定协调黄曲霉素标准（黄曲霉素是某些霉菌产生的有毒成分族），八个成员国——包括意大利、荷兰和西班牙——大幅度提高了国家标准，这或许就是非洲国家队欧洲的谷物、水果干和坚果对欧出口下降6. 7亿美元的原因。
With mutual recognition, the EU and the US would accept each other’s standards or conformity-assessment procedures, allowing firms to adhere to the less stringent requirements in each area.	若采取互相承认，那么欧盟和美国将承认彼此的标准或合规评估程序，企业会在各种标准中选择不太苛刻的那种。
If the policy were extended to third-country firms, it would have a powerful liberalizing impact.	如果该政策扩展到第三国企业，就会产生极大的自由化作用。
For example, Malaysian television producers could choose to comply with, say, America’s easier-to-meet safety standards, then sell the same product in both markets, reaping the benefits of economies of scale while lowering compliance costs.	比如，马来西亚电视生产商可能选择符合（比如）美国较易符合的安全标准，然后在欧美两地销售同样的产品，既享受了规模经济的好处，又降低了合规成本。
If, however, the TTIP excluded third-country firms from the mutual recognition policy, their competitiveness vis-à-vis European and American companies would diminish substantially.	但是，如果TTIP将第三国企业排除在互相承认政策之外，那么它们相对欧洲和美股公司的竞争力将受到极大的削弱。
Indeed, our research shows that when mutual-recognition agreements include restrictive rules of origin, intra-regional trade increases – at the expense of trade with other countries – and that developing countries tend to suffer most.	事实上，我们的研究表明，若互相承诺协议包括严格的来源国限制，则地区内贸易将增加，与其他国家的贸易会削弱，发展中国家损失最大。
In fact, excessively constraining rules of origin have proved problematic for some of the EU’s previous recognition agreements, such as those governing professional-services standards.	事实上，欧盟此前的不少承认协议（比如在专业服务标准方面）表明，过度约束的来源地规则很有问题大有问题。
While a Brazilian orange admitted for sale in Portugal can be sold throughout the EU, a Brazilian engineer or accountant licensed in Portugal must fulfill separate licensing requirements to work elsewhere in the EU, hampering much-needed labor mobility by forcing non-European workers to endure costly and inefficient bureaucratic procedures.	尽管获准在葡萄牙出售的巴西橙可以在整个欧盟出售，但获得葡萄牙执照的巴西工程师和会计师仍必须满足欧盟其他地区各自的执业要求，这迫使非欧洲工人忍受费时费力的官僚主义流程，不利于急需的劳动力流动。
Furthermore, when it comes to tariffs and standards, WTO rules are not created equal.	此外，在关税和标准方面，世贸组织规则并不平等。
While they protect countries excluded from bilateral or regional tariff agreements, thereby ensuring that integrated markets do not receive additional advantages, few safeguards exist to shield third countries from the fallout of agreements on mandatory standards.	尽管世贸组织规则保护着被双边和地区关税协定排除在外的国家，从而确保一体化市场不会获得其他附加的优势，但保护第三国免受强制性标准协议影响的保护措施几乎不存在。
Even in the absence of international rules, the EU and the US could take two actions to ensure that the TTIP does not have adverse consequences for developing economies.	即使没有国际法，欧盟和美国也可以采取两个动作确保TTIP不会损害发展中经济体。
First, they could allow all countries to reap the benefits of a bilateral mutual-recognition deal by agreeing not to impose restrictive rules of origin.	首先，它们可以同意不实施严格的来源地规则，这将使所有国家都能享受到双边互相承认协议的好处。
Second, where they do consider harmonization, they could favor the less stringent of the original standards, unless there is credible evidence that it would not support the relevant regulatory objective.	其次，在考虑协调的领域，它们可以倾向于原始标准中较不苛刻的一个，除非有充分的证据表明这样做不利于相关监管目标。
This is akin to a WTO test for departures from established international standards.	这类似于世贸组织的脱离现行国际标准测试。
If the EU and the US made these two commitments, the rest of the world could follow the TTIP negotiations with hope, rather than trepidation.	如果欧盟和美国实施了这两点，世界其他国家将可以带着希望而不是恐惧追踪TTIP。
A Balanced Look at Sino-American Imbalances	中美贸易不平衡的平衡观
BEIJING – Before July 2007, most economists agreed that global imbalances were the most important threat to global growth.	发自北京——在2007年7月以前，大多数经济学家都认为全球增长的最重大威胁来自于全球贸易不平衡。
It was argued that the United States’ rising net foreign debt-to-GDP ratio – the result of chronic current-account deficits – would put a sharp brake on capital inflows, in turn weakening the dollar, driving up interest rates, and plunging the US economy into crisis.	他们觉得美国净外债与GDP比率的不断上升——这是长期经常账户赤字所引发的后果——将导致资金流入急剧减少，随之削弱美元，而后利率上涨，并最终令美国经济陷入危机当中。
But this scenario failed to materialize. Instead, the crisis stemmed from the US sub-prime debacle, which quickly dragged the global economy into its deepest recession since the 1930’s.	但这一设想却未能成为现实，事实上本次危机源自于美国次级贷款的崩盘，并当即将全球经济拖入了一场自1930年代以来最为严重的衰退当中。
Most economists failed to foresee the economic dynamics that actually led to the crisis, because they failed to pay enough attention to the rapid increase in US total debt.	而大多数经济学家之所以无法预见到危机背后的真正经济驱动力，是因为他们对美国总债务的快速增长缺乏足够的关注。
Instead, they focused exclusively on US foreign debt, ignoring household debt (mortgage and consumer debt), public debt, business debt, and financial debt.	实际上他们把注意力都放在了美国的外债上，却忽视了家庭负债（抵押贷款和消费者债务）、公共负债，商业债务和金融债务等方面的问题。
In particular, they should have paid greater attention to the sustainability of US mortgage and consumer debt.	他们尤其应当对美国抵押贷款和消费者债务的可持续性给予更多的关注。
In 2007, the mortgage and consumer debt-to-GDP ratio was more than 90%, compared to 24% for net foreign debt.	在2007年，上述两项负债与GDP的比率已经上升到90%以上，而与此同时净外债的相关比率只有24%。
Of course, the various components of debt differ considerably in their character and sources of financing – and thus in their sustainability.	当然，债务的不同组成部分也因各自的特性和资金来源而大不相同——而其可持续性也是如此。
But all parts of a country’s total debt and how it is financed are interconnected.	但一国总债务的各个组成部分及其资助方式之间显然是有所关联的。
This means two things. First, funds from different sources of finance are interchangeable to a certain degree: deficiency of funds for one component of total debt can be supplemented by surplus funds originally aimed at financing other components.	这意味着两点，首先：来自不同融资来源的资金在某种程度上是可互换的：总债务中某项资金出现的赤字可以用原本提供给其他用途的多余资金来填补。
Second, troubles in any single component of total debt will have an impact on all the other components.	其二，总债务中某一部分所导致的问题将对其他部分造成影响。
After the subprime crisis erupted, mortgage and consumer debt was paid down by households either with their savings or by default.	在次贷危机爆发之后，美国家庭只能用储蓄来支付抵押贷款和消费者债务，或者被迫放弃偿还。
The fall in US total debt, and the narrowing of the financing gap between total debt and domestic funds, led to a significant improvement in the US current-account deficit in 2008-2009, disproving US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke’s claim that the deficit was caused by a global “saving glut.”	美国总债务的下降，以及总债务和国内资金之间财政缺口的缩窄，都使得美国经常账户赤字状况在2008-2009财年大大改善，也证明美联储主席伯南克宣称该赤字是由全球“储蓄偏好”所引发的观点是错误的。
Indeed, America’s current-account position strengthened despite the dollar’s appreciation in the face of safe-haven demand.	事实上尽管美元在避险需求下升值，美国经常账户状况却得到了巩固。
Unfortunately, as a result of the private-sector deleveraging and an increase in household savings, the US economy, driven by debt and consumption, slid into recession.	但不幸的是，随着私人部门去杠杆化以及家庭储蓄的增加，由负债和消费驱动的美国经济陷入了衰退。
To offset the negative impact of private-sector deleveraging on growth, the US government has maintained expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.	为了减少私人部门去杠杆化对经济增长的负面影响，美国政府采取了一系列扩张性的货币和财政政策。
Now, with household debt sustained on a knife-edge after feverish government intervention, the fiscal position has deteriorated dramatically and the current-account balance has worsened again.	如今政府大力干预后的家庭负债状况依然处于危险边缘，同时财政状况急剧恶化，经常账户平衡状况也再度变差。
Sustainability of public debt has replaced sustainability of private debt as the biggest threat to financial stability, and the focus of debate about the US current account has shifted from the sustainability of foreign debt to the impact of reducing the external deficit on growth and employment.	公共债务的可持续性已经取代私人债务成为美国金融稳定的最大问题，而针对美国经常账户状况的争论焦点也从外债的可持续性转移到外部赤字降低对增长和就业的影响。
The dilemma facing US policymakers is how to stimulate growth while lowering the level of total debt.	对此美国的政策制定者目前陷入了困境：一方面要促进增长，另一方面又得降低总债务水平。
The most important way to achieve both objectives is to increase exports by strengthening US competitiveness.	而实现这两大目标的最重要方式就是透过提升美国国家竞争力的方式来增加出口。
But where will increased competitiveness come from?	但这些竞争力的提升又从何而来？ ，
Devaluation of the dollar could improve US competitiveness in the short run, but it is not a solution.	将美元贬值的做法能在短期内提升美国的竞争力，但却非长久之策。
Because rapid fiscal deterioration now has investors worrying about capital losses on US government securities, devaluation would make foreigners more hesitant to finance America’s budget deficit.	因为财政状况的迅速恶化已经令投资者们对自己美国政府债券上的资本损失忧虑不已，此外贬值也将使外国人更不愿意资助美国的预算赤字。
If foreign financing is not forthcoming, yields on US government debt will rise and the US economy will fall back into recession.	如果得不到外国资金，美国政府债务的收益率将被迫提升而美国经济也将重新陷入衰退。
In the long run, America’s growth pattern must undergo a structural shift from reliance on debt and consumption one based on Americans vaunted capacity for creativity and innovation.	长期来说，美国的发展模式必须由原本对负债和消费的依赖转向美国人引以为荣的创新能力。
Only then will America improve its competitiveness enough to allow the government to reduce both private and public debt to sustainable levels while maintaining a respectable growth rate.	只有这样美国才能真正提升其竞争力，并使政府可以在保持合理增长率的同时将私人和公共债务都降低到一个可持续的水平上。
But neither improved competitiveness, nor reduction of total debt, can be achieved overnight.	但提升竞争力和减少总债务这两个目标都不可能一蹴而就。
In the short run, the US current-account deficit will remain, regardless of which country runs bilateral surpluses.	无论对其拥有双边贸易顺差的是哪一个国家，美国的经常账户赤字将在短期内继续存在。
Thus, China’s continued reinvestment of its current-account surplus in US government securities is of utmost important for US growth and financial stability.	因此中国将其贸易盈余持续投资在美国政府债券上的行为对美国的经济增长和金融稳定都是极为重要的。
Given that America benefits mightily from China’s purchases of US government securities, it is difficult to understand why the US government and Congress have been complaining so much about the bilateral current-account deficit.	考虑到美国在中国购买美国国债方面获取的重大利益，我们很难理解美国政府和国会为何总是对中美双边经常账户赤字大肆抱怨。
It is also difficult to grasp why China is so reluctant to reduce its bilateral surplus, given meager returns on its massive holdings of US government securities and a sustained risk of large capital losses in the future.	而于此同时，我们也难以解释中国为何不愿减少其双边贸易盈余，因为大规模持有美国政府债券回报极低，而且还存在着巨额资本流失风险。
The good news is that, following President Hu Jintao’s recent visit to Washington, both America and China have been taking positive steps to resolve their differences over the bilateral current-account balance.	但好消息是，在中国国家主席胡锦涛最近的访美之行中，中美两国都在解决双边贸易不平衡方面做出了积极的举措。
That augurs well for a more rational and constructive Sino-American dialogue on global imbalances, which would certainly benefit the global economy.	这预示着一个更加理性也更富建设性的中美全球贸易不平衡对话，而这也将对全球经济有所裨益。
A Banking Union Baby Step	银行联盟第一步
BRUSSELS – At the beginning of the financial crisis, it was said that banks were, in Charles Goodhart’s crisp phrase, “international in life, but national in death.”	布鲁塞尔—金融危机开始时，人们用查尔斯·古德哈特（Charles Goodhart）的名言来描述银行：“生而国际，死而民族。
At the time (2008-2009), large international banks had to be rescued by their home countries’ governments when they ran into trouble.	”当是时（2008—2009年），国际大银行在深陷困境时不得不由母国政府出手相救。
But the problem now in Europe is the opposite: banks are “national in life, but European in death.”	但如今，欧洲的问题与此正好相反，银行“生而民族，死而欧洲”。
In Spain, for example, local savings banks (cajas) financed an outsize real-estate boom.	比如，在西班牙，地方储蓄银行是超级地产繁荣的融资提供者。
As the boom turned to bust, the losses threatened to overwhelm the capacity of the Spanish state, and the problem became European, because it threatened the very survival of the euro.	随着繁荣变为萧条，由此产生的损失已快要超过了西班牙整个国家的能力，这一问题变成了欧洲问题，因为事关欧元存亡。
The Spanish case is symptomatic of a larger problem.	西班牙的状况是一个更大问题的症状。
National supervisors always tend to minimize problems at home.	国家层面的监管者总是试图最小化国内问题。
Their instinct (and their bureaucratic interest) is to defend their countries’ “national champion” bank(s) abroad.	他们的本能（也是他们官僚主义利益之所在）是捍卫“国宝”（national champion）银行在国外的表现。
But their resistance to recognizing problems at home runs even deeper.	但他们对辨认国内问题的抵触更加严重。
Until recently, the Spanish authorities maintained that the problems in their country’s real-estate sector were temporary.	直到最近，西班牙当局才不再坚持该国房地产部门问题不是暂时性的。
To acknowledge the truth would have meant admitting that for years they had overlooked the build-up of an unsustainable construction boom that now threatens to bankrupt the entire country.	承认真相意味着多年来他们忽略了不可持续建设繁荣的风险，以至于如今整个国家都陷入了破产危险。
In the case of Ireland, the situation was initially not much different.	在爱尔兰，最初的情况与西班牙并没有太大不同。
When problems started to surface, the finance minister at the time initially claimed that the country would carry out “the cheapest bank rescue ever.”	当问题开始浮现时，时任财政部长宣称爱尔兰将实行“史上成本最小的银行救援”。
Given national supervisors’ predictable tendency not to recognize problems at home, it seemed natural that the cost of cleaning up insolvent banks should also be borne at the national level.	不难预料，国家级监管者总是倾向于对国内问题视而不见，因此，清算资不抵债银行的成本应该由各国自行承担似乎是自然而然的事情。
It thus seemed to make sense that even in the eurozone, banking supervision remained largely national.	于是，即使是在欧元区，银行监管大体上仍维持各国各自为政的局面似乎也不无道理。
The recently created European Banking Authority has only limited powers over national supervisors, whose daily work is guided mainly by national considerations.	新近成立的欧洲银行局所有用的权限比日常工作主要根据国内情况进行的国家级监管者大不了多少。
But reality has shown that this approach is not tenable.	但现实已经证明，这条道路走不通。
Problems might originate at the national level, but, owing to monetary union, they quickly threaten the stability of the entire eurozone banking system.	问题也许肇始于国家层面，但是，由于货币联盟的存在，它们很快会威胁到整个欧元区银行系统的稳定性。
At their June summit, Europe’s leaders finally recognized the need to rectify this situation, transferring responsibility for banking supervision in the eurozone to the European Central Bank.	在6月峰会上，欧洲领导人最终意识到修正这一情况、将欧元区银行监管职能移交给欧洲央行的重要性。
Given that financial integration is particularly strong within the monetary union, putting the ECB in charge was an obvious choice.	作为货币联盟，金融一体化在欧元区非常牢固，这使得欧洲央行成了不二之选。
Moreover, the ECB already bears de facto responsibility for the stability of the eurozone’s banking system.	此外，欧洲央行事实上早已承担起了维持欧元区银行系统稳定的职能。
But, until now, it had to lend massive amounts to banks without being able to judge their soundness, because all of that information was in the hands of national authorities who guarded it jealously and typically denied problems until it was too late.	但是，迄今为止，欧洲央行仍必须在无法判断银行稳健程度的情况下向它们大规模贷款，因为所有信息都掌握在国家级监管者手中，而后者对此死抓不放，出了问题总是拼命掩盖，直到无法收场为止。
Putting the ECB in charge should also help to stop the creeping disintegration process, which is not publicly visible, but is very real nonetheless.	让欧洲央行来行使此职能还有助于阻止正在潜滋暗长的去一体化过程，该过程尽管还没有进入公众视野，但已成为现实威胁。
Just ask any of the large international banking groups headquartered in financially stressed eurozone countries.	只消问问坐落于受困欧元区国家的任何大型国际银行集团总部便可推知一二。
Consider the case of a bank headquartered in Italy, but with an important subsidiary in Germany.	就拿总部设在意大利的某家一行来说吧，这家银行在德国设有一家重要分行。
The German operations naturally generate a surplus of funds (given that savings in Germany far exceed investment on average).	德国分行自然手握资金盈余（因为平均而言德国储蓄远高于投资）。
The parent bank would like to use these funds to reinforce the group’s liquidity.	总行希望使用这笔资金增强整个集团的流动性。
But the German supervisory authorities consider Italy at risk and thus oppose any transfer of funds there.	但德国监管当局认为意大利存在风险，因此反对资金转移。
The supervisor of the home country (Italy) has the opposite interest.	母国（意大利）监管者的利益正好与此相反。
It would like to see the “internal capital market” operate as much as possible.	它希望看到“内部资本市场”操作，越多越好。
Here, too, it makes sense to have the ECB in charge as a neutral arbiter with respect to these opposing interests.	在这里，让欧洲央行来充当尊重这些对立利益的中立仲裁者才是合适的。
But, while putting the ECB in charge of banking supervision solves one problem, it creates another: can national authorities still be held responsible for saving banks that they no longer supervise?	但是，尽管让欧洲央行行使银行监管职能可���解决问题，但也会造成另一个问题：国家级监管当局是否需要继续对其不再行使监管职能的储蓄银行负责？
Economic (and political) logic requires that the eurozone will soon also need a common bank rescue fund.	经济（和政治）逻辑意味着很快欧元区又需要一个共同银行援助基金。
Officially, this has not yet been acknowledged.	这一需要尚未被正式承认。
But that is often the way that European integration proceeds: an incomplete step in one area later requires further steps in related areas.	但此乃欧洲一体化进程中的典型做法：在某领域出台的不完整措施要求在相关领域出台后续措施。
This incremental approach has worked well in the past; indeed, today’s European Union resulted from it.	这一增量办法在过去效果甚丰； 事实上，今天的欧盟就是这样产生的。
But a financial crisis does not give policymakers the time that they once had to explain to voters why one step required another.	但金融危机使得决策者不再像过去那样有时间向选民解释为什么一项措施会带来另一项措施。
They will have to walk much more quickly to save the euro.	他们需要大大加快动作不乏，这样才能拯救欧元。
The Renewed Promise of Abenomics	安倍经济学的新一轮承诺
TOKYO – Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party scored a decisive victory in the December 14 parliamentary election, with Japanese voters demonstrating their overwhelming approval of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s macroeconomic policy agenda.	发自东京——日本自民党在今年12月14日的国会大选中取得了决定性的胜利，因为日本选民们一面倒地支持首相安倍晋三的宏观经济政策议程。
Though voter turnout was relatively low, owing largely to the somewhat technical nature of the issues, the election’s message was clear: most Japanese abhor the prospect of a return to the grim economic trajectory that prevailed in Japan before “Abenomics.”	虽然选民投票率还是相对较低——这在很大程度上源自于这类事务的某种技术性本质——但这场选举所传达出来的信息也非常清晰：大多数日本人都不愿意回到“安倍经济学”之前那种低迷经济轨道中去。
When the first “arrow” of Abenomics – a fiscal stimulus program – was launched nearly two years ago, asset markets' immediate response was positive.	当安倍经济学的第一支箭——财政刺激计划——在两年前射出之后，资产市场立刻作出了积极回应。
The second arrow of Abenomics – monetary easing – intensified these effects.	而安倍经济学的第二支箭——货币宽松——则强化了这一效应。
In the last two years, Japan’s stock market has almost doubled in value, increasing the wealth of Japanese consumers.	在过去两年中，日本股票市场的市值几乎翻了一倍，使消费者的财富得到了增长。
Moreover, the yen has fallen by nearly one-third against the US dollar, from around ¥80 to nearly ¥120 per dollar, invigorating Japan’s export industries.	此外，日元对美元贬值了近三分之一，从原来的约80日元兑1美元下降到近120日元，令日本的出口工业蓬勃发展。
Even more encouraging are developments in the labor market, which, unlike those in asset markets, reflect outcomes, not expectations.	更令人鼓舞的则是劳动力市场的变化发展，跟资产市场不同的是，这反映出了结果，而非仅仅是预期。
Here, too, the news is good.	在这方面形势也十分喜人。
The labor market has tightened, with unemployment standing at 3.5% and the job-to-applicant ratio above parity.	劳动力市场得到了巩固，失业率维持在3. 5%，而职位和求职者的比率则高于1。
To be sure, there have been some setbacks: Japan’s GDP shrank in the second and third quarters of 2014.	无可否认，这其中还存在的一些挫折：日本的GDP在第二和第三季度出现了收缩。
But the downturn, which resulted from April’s consumption-tax hike – from 5% to 8% – cannot be blamed on Abenomics.	但这一由于四月份提升消费税（从5%提到8%）所导致的下滑状况不能归罪于安倍经济学。
Indeed, Abe was honoring a law enacted by the previous government, led by the Democratic Party of Japan.	事实上，安倍只是在遵从由上届日本民主党政府所通过的一项法律而已。
The first two arrows of Abenomics were aimed at stimulating demand – and they were extremely effective.	安倍经济学的头两支箭都旨在刺激需求——而且也极为有效。
The consumption-tax hike was needed to sustain them in flight. Unfortunately, the hike was too large to keep them aloft.	同时也需要提升消费税来维持这两支箭的顺利飞行，但不幸的是，此次提升的幅度过大，反而对这两项政策造成了阻碍。
The good news is that the tax hike’s impact is temporary. Soon, it will begin to taper off, and industrial output will approach full capacity.	好消息是增税的影响只是暂时的，并将很快开始逐渐消失，而工业产量则会接近满负荷。
When demand begins to exceed supply, demand-side stimulus policies will become increasingly ineffective, and it will be time to launch the third arrow of Abenomics: growth-enhancing structural reforms.	当需求开始超过供给的时候，需求端的刺激政策将逐渐变得无效，是时候射出安倍经济学的第三支箭：强化增长的结构性改革。
Such reforms are essential to raise productivity growth and improve the Japanese economy’s competitiveness.	为了提升生产力增长并改善日本的经济竞争力，这类改革极有必要。
Four imperatives stand out.	而其中则凸显出四项要点：
The first task should be to eliminate – or, at least, reduce – the thicket of government regulations that is stifling economic dynamism.	首要任务应当是消除——或至少要减少——遏制经济活力的一大堆政府管制。
The current system is so convoluted and complex that it took more than three decades to open a new medical school in Tokyo.	现行的系统是如此的繁琐复杂，以致在东京开设一所新医学院需要花费超过30年时间。
Likewise, flights to Haneda airport, a convenient connection to the Tokyo city area, have been rationed.	同样，飞往羽田机场这个通往东京市区的便利转接点的航班也受到限制。
This is no formula for long-term economic success.	这显然不是一个促进长期经济繁荣的做法。
Furthermore, Japan’s government should push to complete negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is currently being negotiated among 12 countries, from Mexico to the United States to Vietnam.	此外，日本政府应当加紧完成跨太平洋伙伴计划的谈判。 目前已经有十二个国家参与该项谈判，涵盖从墨西哥到美国再到越南的广大区域。
The TPP would improve Japan’s trade prospects considerably, including in sensitive sectors like agriculture, where exports of fast-moving consumer goods like flowers and vegetables would benefit.	这一伙伴计划极大提升日本的贸易前景，包括像在农业这样的敏感部门，因为像鲜花和蔬菜之类快速消费品的出口将因此而受益。
Japan’s leaders must also work to expand the workforce, which faces severe constraints, owing largely to the country’s rapidly aging population.	日本领导人也必须扩大由于本国的快速老龄化而面临严重制约的劳动力队伍。
In the absence of large-scale immigration, to which Japanese remain unamenable, one relatively simple solution would be to integrate more women into the labor force.	在缺乏大规模移民，日本又不准备开放移民的情况下，一个相对简单的解决方案将是把更多的女性融入劳动力大军。
A 10% increase in Japan’s female labor-force participation rate – an entirely attainable goal – would translate into an almost 5% gain in total labor-force participation.	如果日本的女性劳动力参与率能提升10%——这是一个完全可以实现的目标——那就将把整体的劳动力参与率提升近5%。
Finally, Abe’s government must reduce the corporate-tax rate to align it more closely with international standards.	最后安倍政府必须削减企业税率，使其与国际标准接轨。
Amid increasingly intense international competition to attract foreign investment, reducing the corporate tax would actually increase Japan’s tax revenues, by spurring companies to invest their vast cash stockpiles in more productive activities.	在国际间日渐激烈的外国投资争夺战中，通过驱使企业将自身的巨额现金储备投入到更具生产力的活动当中，减少企业税率将在事实上增加日本的税收收入。
Now that Abe’s government has a renewed mandate from Japanese voters, it must deliver on its promises – and that means decisive and comprehensive implementation of structural reforms.	如今安倍政府已经获得了日本选民的新一轮授权，也必须兑现自己的承诺——这意味着坚定而全面地实施结构改革。
Of course, this will require some sacrifices.	这当然需要作出某些牺牲。
Indeed, households have already endured some hardship, brought about by the consumption-tax hike.	事实上日本家庭已经在承受着因为消费税提升而带来的艰难状况。
The next step is for Abe’s government to use its political capital to overcome vested interests, both in the bureaucracy and the business community.	而安倍政府的下一步则是利用自身的政治资本去制服既得利益阶层——包括政界与商界。
This means compelling businesses to give up some of the special tax benefits they now enjoy.	这意味着迫使企业放弃某些目前享有的特殊税务优惠。
For their part, politicians must participate in the taxpayer identification system.	政治家则必须参与到纳税人识别体系中来。
And bureaucrats must forego some of the power that excessive regulation affords them.	而政府官员们则要放弃路管制所赋予他们的某些权利。
If all of these groups join the Japanese public in accepting reasonable sacrifices, Abe’s government can fulfill its promise and build a thriving economy.	如果上述这些团体能和日本民众一道接受和承担合理的牺牲，安倍政府就能兑现自身的承诺并建立一个兴旺繁荣的经济。
For the sake of all Japanese – not to mention a world economy in need of a new source of dynamism – that promise deserves to be met.	为了日本的整体利益——不要说一个需要新动力来源的世界经济——这个承诺值得去兑现。
The Missing Arrow of Abenomics	安倍经济学的迷失之箭
TOKYO – In his drive to kick-start the Japanese economy, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, shortly after taking office in 2012, introduced a large fiscal stimulus and put in place a bold program of monetary easing.	东京—日本首相安倍晋三在2012年执政后不久就开始了振兴日本经济的政策，他引入了大规模财政刺激和激进的货币宽松计划。
Since then, Japanese policymakers have been working to launch what Abe calls the third “arrow” of his agenda: arduous reforms of key industries and the demolition of structural barriers to growth.	此后，日本决策者一直致力于启动安倍所谓的第三支“箭”：重要行业的艰巨改革计划以及破除增长的结构性壁垒。
But the focus on public policy has left a “fourth arrow” – the private sector – untouched and seemingly ignored.	但专注于公共政策让“第四支箭”——私人部门——被冷落一旁，似乎遭到了忽略。
This is unfortunate, because the government cannot fix Japan’s ills on its own.	这是不幸的，因为政府无法单枪匹马治好日本病。
Annual productivity growth has been stubbornly sluggish, rarely rising above 2% for much of the past two decades, reflecting both missed opportunities and declining cost competitiveness.	年生产率增长极其低迷，在过去20年中的大部分时间里还不到2%，这表明机会被错失，成本竞争力在下降。
Japan’s productivity slump permeates the entire economy; labor and capital productivity gains have nearly stalled in almost every sector – even in Japan’s signature advanced manufacturing industries.	日本生产率大降是整个经济的普遍现象； 几乎所有部门的劳动和资本生产率都近乎停滞——即使是日本标志性的发达的制造业。
Labor productivity in the transport-equipment sector, for example, is barely half that of Germany.	比如，运输设备劳动生产率大约只有德国的一半。
This trend puts annual GDP growth on course to average only 1.3% through 2025, implying a third consecutive decade of stagnation.	这一趋势意味着到2025年，日本年GDP增长率平均将只有1. 3%，连续第三个十年陷入停滞。
Such an outcome would coincide with – and exacerbate the effects of – an adverse demographic shift that will constrain fiscal revenues and drive up costs for universal health care and pension benefits.	这一结果恰逢不利的人口趋势——并将放大后者的效应——制约财政收入，增加全民医疗和退休金福利的成本。
Japan’s ability to alter its trajectory depends on individual companies making decisions to invest, change workplace policies, deploy new technologies, and test untried business models.	日本能否摆脱这一轨道取决于个体公司决定投资、改变工作场所政策、采用新技术以及尝试未尝试的业务模式。
Abe’s structural reforms will take time and political will to enact, but Japanese companies cannot afford to sit still.	安倍的结构改革需要时间，还需要实施的政治意愿，但日本公司决不能坐等。
They can and must act, without waiting for the government to change its policies.	它们能够也必须行动起来，不必等政府改变政策。
In many cases, the economy’s bottlenecks are not regulatory in nature, but stem from entrenched ways of doing business.	在许多情形中，经济瓶颈并非监管，而是来自根深蒂固的生意经。
New research by the McKinsey Global Institute examines Japan’s advanced manufacturing, retail, financial services, and health-care industries in detail – and finds substantial untapped productivity potential in every area.	麦肯锡全球研究所（McKinsey Global Institute）的新研究详细考察了日本发达的制造业、零售业、金融服务业和医疗业——发现这些领域无不存在巨大的未利用生产率潜力。
For starters, Japanese firms must become more globally integrated.	首先，日本企业必须更加融入全球。
Exporting to the fastest-growing overseas markets is one obvious route to overcoming sluggish demand growth at home.	向增长最快的海外市场出口显然是克服国内需求增长停滞的一个办法。
But, rather than just selling products abroad, Japanese enterprises need to expand operations beyond their borders and cast a wider net for international talent.	但是，日本企业所需要的不仅仅是将产品卖到海外，还需要扩大海外经营，组织更广阔的国际人才网。
Japanese companies have formidable R&amp;D operations, but most will need to reconfigure them to obtain better returns and impact.	日本公司拥有可怕的研发部门，但大部分需要重组以获得更好的回报和影响。
The process must start with an understanding of what the customer wants and a determination to deliver solutions accordingly.	这一过程必须首先理解客户想要什么并决心据此提供解决方案。
Closed and tightly managed R&amp;D operations must be transformed into more fluid, open processes involving collaboration with customers and suppliers.	管理严格的封闭研发业务必须变得更具流动性、更加开放，把客户和供应商也包括进来。
Japanese companies will also need to improve their capabilities in areas such as marketing, pricing, and talent development.	日本公司还需要提高营销、定价和人才开发等领域的能力。
While there are some pockets of excellence, most Japanese firms are severely lacking in these areas.	尽管在这些领域表现出众的日本企业不少，但大部分仍严重缺乏这方面的能力。
To compete in global markets, they will need to achieve the same consistency in these areas that they have in their traditional areas of strength.	要想在全球市场上竞争，它们需要实现与传统优势领域同样的一致性。
Many Japanese companies have yet to digitize paper-based processes and replace outdated information-technology systems.	许多日本公司至今仍未实现纸面流程的数字化和更新过时的信息技术系统。
Others would benefit from moving beyond basic digitization to next-generation technologies, such as big-data analytics.	其他公司可以跨越基本数字化，向新一代技术（如大数据分析）迈进，并从中获益。
Companies can also head off looming labor shortages with intelligent software systems and robotics.	公司还可以用智能软件系统和机器人解决劳动力短缺的问题。
Manufacturers can augment or replace their assembly lines with technologies such as the Internet of Things and 3D printing.	制造商可以用物联网和3D打印等技术扩大或代替流水线。
More broadly, Japanese companies have to organize for performance and discipline.	更广泛地说，日本公司必须以业绩和纪律为目标进行组织。
As policy changes unleash market forces, businesses will face greater competition.	随着政策变化解放市场力量，企业将面临更大的竞争。
Some may need to reorganize or exit unprofitable markets; others may have to undertake mergers and acquisitions to achieve economies of scale.	一些企业也许需要重组或退出无利可图的市场； 令一些企业也许必须进行兼并收购以实现规模经济。
Finally, shareholders and senior executives should tie performance goals to incentives.	最后，股东和高管应该将业绩目标与激励挂钩。
Some of Japan’s corporate giants have already begun shifting from traditional seniority-based advancement toward merit-based pay structures.	一些日本大公司以开始将基于传统年资的晋升模式改变为基于表现的薪酬结构。
Others should follow their lead.	其他公司应该效仿。
Promoting younger and more diverse talent can create agile organizations with fresh ideas.	提拔更年轻、更多样化的人才能够用新思维为组织注入活力。
If Japan’s private sector rises to the challenge, it can move the economy onto a path of faster growth.	如果日本私人部门奋起迎接挑战，可以推动经济走上更快的增长路径。
Innovations in one company would cascade across its entire industry by forcing competitors to raise their game.	一家公司的创新奖迫使竞争者更加投入竞争，从而提升整个行业。
In the 1950s and 1960s, for example, Toyota introduced more efficient production processes that were eventually adopted by the entire automobile industry.	比如，20世纪五六十年代，丰田引入了效率更高的生产流程，并最终被整个汽车行业所采用。
Instead of settling for a future of 1.3% annual GDP growth, Japan could attain roughly 3% annual growth through 2025.	日本不应该满足于1. 3%的未来年GDP增长率，它可以到2025年实现大约3%的年增长率。
Doing so would require the growth rate of labor productivity to more than double, but this is an attainable goal.	这样做要求劳动力生产率翻一番以上，但仍是可实现的目标。
More than half of this growth increment can be met by adopting best practices that companies around the world already use, while technology can close much of the remaining gap.	一大半增长增量可以通过采取全球公司已在使用的最佳实践实现，而技术可以填补大部分余下的空缺。
Japanese business leaders need to combine big thinking with a focused attention to detail.	日本商界领袖需要将大局观和细节专注结合起来。
They will need to create innovative products, penetrate new markets, and make bold investments in equipment, technology, and talent, while simultaneously scrutinizing every aspect of their operations for inefficiency and waste.	他们需要创造创新性产品，渗透新市场，积极地投资于设备、技术和人才，同时仔细检视经营的每个方面以发现低效和浪费。
Traditional ways of doing business may have to be abandoned.	传统生意经必须抛弃。
But there is ample scope to make progress and spur faster economic growth.	但取得进步、刺激更快经济增长的空间很大。
Immense trade flows, the rise of billions of new consumers in the emerging world, and technology breakthroughs are rapidly transforming the global economy.	巨大的贸易流、新兴世界数十亿新消费者的崛起以及技术突破正在快速改变全球经济。
Japan can shift its current trajectory by turning this wave of disruption into opportunity.	日本可以将这一破坏潮转化为机遇，摆脱当前的轨迹。
From Russia With Unrequited Love	对俄罗斯的单恋
NEW DELHI – Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has assiduously courted Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting with him more than a dozen times in four years.	新德里—日本首相安倍晋三孜孜不倦地讨好俄罗斯总统普京，在四年内和他进行了十多次会晤。
This month he hosted Putin in Tokyo and in his hometown of Nagato (famed for its onsen, or natural hot springs).	这个月，他在东京和家乡山口县（以温泉闻名）接待了普京。
But Abe’s courtship has so far yielded little for Japan, and much for Russia.	但安倍的追求没有给日本带来什么好处，倒是给俄罗斯送去了很多利益。
Abe’s diplomatic overtures to Putin are integral to his broader strategy to position Japan as a counterweight to China, and to rebalance power in Asia, where Japan, Russia, China, and India form a strategic quadrangle.	安倍对普京的外交姿态是他的战略大局的一部分：将日本定位为中国的制衡力量和亚洲的再平衡力量。 日本、俄罗斯、中国和印度组成了一个亚洲战略四边形。
Abe has already built a close relationship with India, and he sees improved relations with Russia – with which Japan never formally made peace after World War II – as the missing ingredient for a regional power equilibrium.	安倍已经建立了与印度的紧密关系，并将改善对俄关系——二战后日本从未与俄罗斯媾和——视为地区实力平衡的缺失的一角。
But Abe’s trust-building efforts with Russia are not aimed only at checking Chinese aggression.	但安倍与俄罗斯构建信任的努力不仅是为了制衡中国的野心。
He also wants Russia to return its southernmost Kuril Islands – a resource-rich area known as the Northern Territories in Japan – which the Soviet Union seized just after the United States dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.	他还希望俄罗斯归还千岛群岛最南端拥有丰富资源的北方四岛。 1945年美国在广岛和长期投下原子弹后，苏联占领了这四个岛屿。
In exchange, Abe has offered economic aid, investments in Russia’s neglected Far East, and major energy deals.	作为交换，安倍提出向俄罗斯提供经济援助、投资被忽视的远东地区以及能源大单。
Abe has, however, encountered several obstacles.	但是，安倍面临着多重阻碍。
For starters, Japan is a participant in the US-led sanctions that were imposed on Russia after it annexed Crimea in March 2014.	首先，日本是以美国为首的对俄制裁的参与者。
These sanctions have pushed Russia closer to its traditional rival, China; and Putin has publicly identified the sanctions as a hindrance to concluding a peace treaty with Japan.	制裁自2014年3月俄罗斯入侵克里米亚后开始实施，这让俄罗斯与其传统对手中国越走越近； 而普京公开表示制裁是日俄缔结和平条约的障碍。
In response to Abe’s overtures, Putin has doggedly tried to drive a hard bargain.	作为对安倍的姿态的回应，普京一直奉行强硬的讨价还价。
Russia has bolstered its defenses on the four disputed islands, and, just prior to this month’s summit, he told the Japanese media that the current territorial arrangement suits Russian interests.	俄罗斯加强了其在北方四岛的防御部署，而在本月峰会前夕普京告诉日本媒体，目前的领土状况符合俄罗斯利益。
“We think that we have no territorial problems,” he said. “It’s Japan that thinks that it has a territorial problem with Russia.”	“我们认为我们没有领土问题，”他说，“只是日本认为它和俄罗斯之间存在领土问题。
The US-led sanctions regime and low oil prices have battered the Russian economy, which is expected to contract by 0.8% in 2016.	以美国为首的制裁和低油价打击了俄罗斯经济，预计2016年俄罗斯经济将收缩0.
Thus, Putin is more reluctant than ever to offer territorial concessions, lest it tarnish his domestic image as a staunch defender of Russian national interests.	8%。 因此，普京更加不愿意在领土问题上让步，唯恐玷污其俄罗斯国家利益坚定捍卫者的国内形象。
Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that Abe left the recent “onsen summit” with dashed hopes of resolving the territorial dispute, while Putin returned home with 68 new commercial accords.	在这样的背景下，安倍在“温泉峰会”解决领土争议的希望破灭，而俄罗斯带着68份新商业协议回国，这一结果一点都不令人惊讶。
Many of the new agreements are symbolic, but some are substantive, including deals worth $2.5 billion and an agreement to set up a $1 billion bilateral-investment fund.	新协议中不少是象征性的，但也有一些是实质性的，包括一份价值25亿美元、成立一个10亿美元双边投资基金的协议。
Under the latter agreement, Japan and Russia are supposed create a “special framework” for joint economic activities on the disputed islands.	在后一份协议中，日本和俄罗斯将建立一个“特殊框架”管理争议岛屿上的经济活动。
But the plan has already run into trouble.	但该计划已经遇到了麻烦。
Peter Shelakhaev, a senior Russian official who leads the government’s Far East Investment and Export Agency, has indicated that there are legal hurdles to establishing such a framework, and that Japanese firms doing business on the Kurils would have to pay taxes to Russia.	俄罗斯政府远东投资和出口局（Far East Investment and Export Agency）主管彼得·舍拉哈耶夫（Peter Shelakhaev）表示建立这一框架存在法律障碍，在南千岛群岛经营的日本企业必须向俄罗斯纳税。
If Japan did that, however, it would effectively be recognizing Russia’s jurisdiction over the islands.	但是，如果日本照办，就等于承认了俄罗斯对这些岛屿的司法管辖权。
Abe has thus been denied the legacy that he sought, while Putin has succeeded in easing Russia’s international isolation.	因此，安倍想要的东西被拒绝了，而普京成功地缓解了俄罗斯的孤立。
Abe was the first G7 leader to hold a summit with Putin after Russia annexed Crimea, and now Russia has won Japan’s economic cooperation, too.	安倍是俄罗斯吞并克里米亚后第一位与普京举行峰会的G7领导人，眼下俄罗斯赢得了日本的经济合作。
Japan is the only G7 country that has a territorial dispute with Russia, and it is clearly more eager to reach a deal than the Kremlin is.	日本是唯一一个与俄罗斯存在领土纠纷的G7国家，并且它显然比克里姆林宫更渴望达成协议。
But this has only strengthened Russia’s hand.	但这正中俄罗斯下怀。
While Japan has softened its position, and signaled that it may accept only a partial return of the islands, Russia has grown only more intransigent.	日本立场有所软化，并且释放出信号可以接受局部归还争议岛屿，而俄罗斯的立场变得更加强硬。
After the recent summit, Abe revealed that Putin now seems to be reneging on a 1956 agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union, which stipulates that the smaller two of the four islands will be returned to Japan after a peace treaty is signed.	最新峰会后，安倍透露普京似乎否1956年日本与苏联签订的协议，该协议规定北方四岛中较小的两个将在日俄缔结和平条约后归还日本。
As it happens, this year marks the 60th anniversary of that joint declaration, which was widely viewed as a breakthrough at the time.	今年是这一联合声明签署60周年，当时，这份声明被广泛视为是一个突破。
The Kremlin is now suggesting that its commitment to fulfilling the declaration was conditional on Japan not joining any security alliance against Russia.	如今，克里姆林宫表示它是否会兑现声明的条件是日本不加入针对俄罗斯的安全联盟。
And Putin has expressed concerns that the 1960 Japan-US Security Treaty would extend to the disputed islands if they were returned, thus allowing the US to establish a military presence there.	普京还表示担心，1960年日美安全条约范围将扩大到归还的两岛，从而美国也能够在那里部署军事设施。
Japan is in no position to address Russia’s concerns.	日本没有为俄罗斯解决担忧的立场。
It cannot opt out of the US-led sanctions regime; and it cannot exempt the disputed Kurils from its security treaty with the US, especially now that it has been urging the US to provide an explicit commitment to defend the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, over which China claims sovereignty.	它不能选择跳出美国领导的制裁； 也不能让争议的北方四岛不受日美安全条约的管辖，特别是在如今日本一直在敦促美国就捍卫日本控制、中国主张主权的钓鱼岛做出明确承诺的时候。
Putin, for his part, appears smugly content with his negotiating position.	至于普京，他似乎对他的谈判立场相当满意。
Not only did he arrive almost three hours late to the onsen summit, in keeping with his habit of leaving foreign leaders waiting; he also declined a Japanese government gift – a male companion for his native Japanese Akita dog, which Japan gave him in 2012.	在温泉峰会上，他迟到了三小时，延续了他让外国领导人等他的习惯； 还拒绝了日本政府的礼物——为日本2012年送给他的日本秋田犬配一只雄性伴侣。
There is little hope now that Abe will see tangible returns on the political capital he has invested in cultivating Putin.	如今，安倍为讨好普京而掷下的政治资本基本上是打了水漂。
And Japan’s dilemma will only deepen.	而日本的困境反而更加深化了。
US President-elect Donald Trump’s desire to improve relations with Russia may give Abe leeway to continue wooing Putin; but if Russia gets the US in its corner, it won’t need Japan anymore.	美国当选总统唐纳德·特朗普准备缓和对俄关系或许有利于安倍继续讨好普京； 但如果俄罗斯得到了美国，就再也不需要日本了。
A Berlin Consensus?	柏林共识?
HONG KONG – A recent trip to Berlin brought back memories of an earlier visit in the summer of 1967, when I was a poor student who marveled at the Wall that would divide and devastate an entire society for another two decades.	发自香港——最近的柏林之行令我回想起了自己的上一次到访，那是1967年的夏天，作为一个穷学生的我，在那堵还将继续分割和压抑整个德国社会20多年的高墙前震惊不已。
Berlin today is vibrant and rejuvenated, rebuilt by the German peoples' hard work and sacrifice to unify the country, and an apt setting for the conference of the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET), which I was there to attend.	如今在德国人民的艰苦努力以及为统一做出的牺牲之下，柏林早已生机勃勃，重现往日活力，此外新经济思维研究中心（Institute for New Economic Thinking）会议适当的议题设置对此也有贡献，而本人正是来参加这场会议的。
The conference’s theme was “Paradigm Lost,” with more than 300 economists, political scientists, systems analysts, and ecologists gathering to rethink economic and political theory for the challenges and uncertainty posed by growing inequality, rising unemployment, global financial disarray, and climate change.	会议的主题是“范式的失落”，超过300位经济学家，政治科学家，系统分析者和生态学者齐聚一堂，讨论当今日渐恶化的不平等状况、失业率升高，全球金融紊乱和气候变化等问题所引发的挑战以及不确定性，并重新思考与之对应的经济和政治理论。
Almost everyone agreed that the old paradigm of neoclassical economics was broken, but there was no agreement on what can replace it.	几乎所有与会代表都赞同一点，那就是新古典主义经济学的旧有范式已经失效，但在何种范式可以取而代之这一点上却未能达成共识。
Nobel laureate Amartya Sen attributed the European crisis to four failures – political, economic, social, and intellectual.	诺贝尔经济学奖得主阿马蒂亚·森（Amartya Sen）在会上指出，欧洲的危机源自于四个方面的失效——政治、经济，社会和智力层面。
The global financial crisis, which began in 2007 as a crisis of US subprime lending and has broadened into a European sovereign-debt (and banking) crisis, has raised questions that we cannot answer, owing to over-specialization and fragmentation of knowledge.	这场全球金融危机——始于2007年美国次级贷危机并最终扩大成为欧洲主权债务（及银行）危机——提出了一些我们无法回答的问题，而其原因则是知识的过度专业化和碎片化。
And yet there is no denying that the world has become too intricate for any simple, overarching theory to explain complex economic, technological, demographic, and environmental shifts.	同时也无可否认，我们的世界已经变得极端复杂，以致无法用任何简单且高度概括性的理论去解释在经济、技术，人口构成以及环境方面的所发生的复杂转变。
In particular, the rise of emerging markets has challenged traditional Western deductive and inductive logic.	尤其重要的是，新兴市场的崛起使西方的演绎和归纳逻辑遭到了挑战。
Deductive inference enables us to predict effects if we know the principles (the rule) and the cause.	演绎推理使我们在知道原理（法则）和起因的情况下可以预测出结果。
By inductive reasoning, if we know the cause and effects, we can infer the principles.	而通过使用归纳法，我们则可以在知道前因后果的情况下推断出中间的原理。
Eastern thinking, by contrast, has been abductive, moving from pragmatism to guessing the next steps.	相比之下，东方的思考方式则是溯因式的，从实用主义出发去猜测下一步该如何行动。
Abductive inference is pragmatic, looking only at outcomes, guessing at the rule, and identifying the cause.	溯因推理注重实效，只关注结果，通过结果来猜想原理，再由此确定原因。
Like history, social-scientific theory is written by the victors and shaped by the context and challenges of its time.	以历史为例，社会-科学理论是由胜利者撰写的，同时也受到特定时代背景和当时（社会主要）矛盾的影响。
Free-market thinking evolved from Anglo-Saxon theorists (many from Scotland), who migrated and colonized territories, allowing fortunate individuals to assume that there were no limits to consumption.	自由市场理念演化自盎格鲁-撒克逊理论家（其中许多来自苏格兰），他们不断移居和殖民新的地域，让那些拥有财富的个人觉得消费是会无限增长的。
European continental thinking, responding to urbanization and the need for social order, emphasized institutional analysis of political economy.	而欧洲大陆的思想则主要服务于城市化以及对社会秩序的追求，因此强调对政治经济的体制性分析。
Thus, the emergence of neoclassical economics in the nineteenth century was very much influenced by Newtonian and Cartesian physics, moving from qualitative analysis to quantifying human behavior by assuming rational behavior and excluding uncertainty.	因此，新古典主义经济学在19世纪的崛起在很大程度上都是受到了牛顿和笛卡尔流派物理学的影响，从定性分析转向对人类行为的定量分析，假设这些行为都是理性的同时不断对不确定性加以排除。
This “predetermined equilibrium” thinking – reflected in the view that markets always self-correct – led to policy paralysis until the Great Depression, when John Maynard Keynes’s argument for government intervention to address unemployment and output gaps gained traction.	这一“预先设定的均衡”理念——认为市场总能自我纠正——导致了政策瘫痪，直到大萧条来袭，而约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）则因此提出政府应当出手干涉失业问题，而产出与消费之间的差距问题也得到了重视。
By the 1970’s, the neoclassical general-equilibrium school captured Keynesian economics through real-sector models that assumed that “finance is a veil,” thereby becoming blind to financial markets’ destabilizing effects.	到了1970年代，新古典主义总体均衡学派通过一个假设“金融只是一张包装纸”的实体部门模型说服了凯恩斯主义者，并因此令他们对金融市场的不稳定作用一无所知。
Economists like Hyman Minsky, who tried to correct this, were largely ignored as Milton Friedman and others led the profession’s push for free markets and minimal government intervention.	海曼·明斯基（Hyman Minsky）这样的经济学家尝试去纠正这一错误，但当时领导经济学界的是米尔顿·弗里德曼等自由市场和最小政府的鼓吹者，于是明斯基之辈也只能默默无闻了。
But then technology, demographics, and globalization brought dramatic new challenges that the neoclassical approach could not foresee.	但随后出现的科技，人口分布特征和全球化则令新古典经济学派迎来了意料之外的挑战。
Even as the world’s advanced countries over-consumed through leveraging from derivative finance, four billion of the world’s seven billion people began moving to middle-income status, making huge demands on global resources and raising the issue of ecological sustainability.	随着全球发达国家通过金融衍生品提供的杠杆来实现过度消费，世界70亿人口中有40亿开始进入中等收入状态，不但对全球资源造成了巨大需求，也催生了环境生态的可持续发展问题。
New thinking is required to manage these massive and systemic changes, as well as the integration of giants like China and India into the modern world.	我们需要新的思维来应对这些大规模且系统性的变革需要，同时也需要把中国和印度这样的大国整合进入现代世界。
A change of mindset is needed not just in the West, but also in the East.	不但西方需要转换思维，东方也是如此。
In 1987, the historian Ray Huang explained it for China:	为此历史学家黄仁宇早在1987年就针对中国进行了论述：
“As the world enters the modern era, most countries under internal and external pressure need to reconstruct themselves by substituting the mode of governance rooted in agrarian experience with a new set of rules based on commerce.…This is easier said than done.	&#160;“随着世界进入现代时期，大多数承受着内部和外部压力的国家都必须对自身进行重建，用基于商业的一套法则来取代原���构建于农业经验之上的管治模式……但这是件知易行难的事。
The renewal process could affect the top and bottom layers, and inevitably it is necessary to recondition the institutional links between them.	整个更新过程将影响到上下两个阶层，并不可避免地需要重新修复两者之间的体制联系。
Comprehensive destruction is often the order; and it may take decades to bring the work to completion.”	全面破坏将成为常态； 而且往往需要数十年来完成这项工作。
Using this macro-historical framework, we can see Japanese deflation, European debt, and even the Arab Spring as phases of systemic changes within complex structures that are interacting with one another in a new, multipolar global system.	利用微历史的框架，我们可以看到一个新的，多极化全球体系之中存在着许多不断产生互动的复杂结构，而日本通胀，欧洲债务甚至阿拉伯之春则可被视为这些结构内部某一阶段的系统性变革。
We are witnessing simultaneous global convergence (the narrowing of income, wealth, and knowledge gaps between countries) and local divergence (widening income, wealth, and knowledge gaps within countries).	我们正见证着各种同时进行中的全球收敛现象（各国之间收入，财富和知识差距的不断收窄）以及本地分化现象（各国内部收入，财富和知识差距的不断加大）。
Adaptive systems struggle with order and creativity as they evolve.	适应性系统在演化的过程中会不断在秩序和创新性之间左右摇摆。
As the philosopher Bertrand Russell presciently put it: “Security and justice require centralized governmental control, which must extend to the creation of a world government if it is to be effective.	正如英国哲学家伯特兰·罗素（Bertrand Russell）所预见的那样：“安全与正义要求集权化的政府控制，而这个系统如果要达到有效的话就势必要扩张成为一个全球政府。
Progress, on the contrary, requires the utmost scope for personal initiative that is compatible with social order.”	相反，进步则要求实现一个与社会秩序相容的，最大范围的个人主动性。 ”
A new wave of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter famously called “creative destruction” is under way: even as central banks struggle to maintain stability by flooding markets with liquidity, credit to business and households is shrinking.	一个被经济学家约瑟夫·熊彼得（Joseph Schumpeter）称之为“创造性破坏”的新浪潮已经涌现：即便中央银行奋力通过向市场注入大量流动性来保持稳定，对企业和家庭的信贷依然不断紧缩。 我们生活在一个对通胀和通缩的两大恐惧同时并存的时代；
We live in an age of simultaneous fear of inflation and deflation; of unprecedented prosperity amid growing inequality; and of technological advancement and resource depletion.	既有前所未有的繁荣，又有不断扩大的不平等； 一方面科技进步，另一方面则存在资源枯竭。
Meanwhile, existing political systems promise good jobs, sound governance, a sustainable environment, and social harmony without sacrifice – a paradise of self-interested free riders that can be sustained only by sacrificing the natural environment and the welfare of future generations.	与此同时，现有的政治系统既不愿意做出牺牲，却又承诺会提供好工作，优秀管治，可持续环境和社会和谐——这是一个自私自利的搭便车者梦想的天堂，但代价则是牺牲了自然环境以及子孙后代的福祉。
We cannot postpone the pain of adjustment forever by printing money.	我们不能通过印钞的方式永远推迟承担适应变革所带来的阵痛。
Sustainability can be achieved only when the haves become willing to sacrifice for the have-nots.	只有当既得利益者愿意为非既得利益者做出牺牲的时候，可持续性才可能实现。
The Washington Consensus of free-market reforms for developing countries ended more than two decades ago.	针对发展中国国家自由市场改革的华盛顿共识已经在20年前达成。
The INET conference in Berlin showed the need for a new one – a consensus that supports sacrifice in the interest of unity.	而柏林新经济思维研究中心会议则显示我们需要一个新的共识——为了团结统一而做出牺牲。
Europe could use it.	欧洲当采用之。
Accepting Japan at Its Word	接受日本的用词
TOKYO – In recent years, the number of tourists visiting Japan has been increasing rapidly, reaching a record 13.4 million last year, a 29% increase from 2013.	东京—近几年来，访日游客数量迅速增长，去年创出1,340万人次新高，比2013年增加29%。
Japan seems to be making great strides toward its goal of recapturing the position as an Asian cultural center that it held a century ago, when the Indian Nobel laureate poet Rabindranath Tagore lived in Tokyo.	日本似乎正在大踏步向重新成为亚洲文化中心的目标迈进。 一百年前，也就是印度诺贝尔奖诗人泰戈尔生活在东京的时候，日本曾经是亚洲文化中心。
Chinese revolutionary leaders Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek, along with many other prominent Asians, moved there as well.	中国革命领袖孙中山和蒋介石以及其他诸多亚洲名人也纷纷来到日本。
Anyone visiting Japan today would do well to learn two key words: domo, meaning “hello,” “thanks,” or “well,” and sumimasen, which can carry any of the meanings of domo, as well as “sorry” or “excuse me.”	如今，所有来日旅客都会学会两个关键词：“多末”，意思是“你好”、“谢谢”或“很好”； 以及“斯米马赛”，它包括了domo的全部含义，还可以表达“对不起”和“劳驾”。
Ordinary Japanese say sumimasen countless times each day, to apologize to friends or strangers for even the most trivial accident or mistake.	普通日本人每天都要说无数次“斯米马赛”，有一点点事情或犯一点点错误就用这个词向朋友或陌生人致歉。
But, as Japan’s leaders have experienced firsthand since World War II, expressing regret to other countries is not so simple.	但是，自二战以来，日本领导人真切地感受到，向其他国家表达悔恨之情并不那么简单。
Yet that is precisely what Prime Minister Shinzo Abe must do in his upcoming statement marking the 70th anniversary of the end of the war.	但这正是首相安倍晋三在即将到来的二战结束70周年纪念讲话中所要做的。
The statement will be based on consultations with many of Japan’s, and the world’s, leading WWII historians, as well as – and more important – with himself, his conscience, and his heart, because he understands the significance of his words on this highly fraught topic.	该讲话将以诸多日本乃至全球著名二战史家的意见为基础，但更重要的是安倍本人、他的良知和他的用心，因为他明白，在这个高度敏感的话题上，他的用语意义重大。
Of course, Abe is far from the first Japanese leader to confront this challenge.	当然，安倍绝非首位面临如此挑战的日本领导人。
His statement will follow a long line of declarations by prime ministers and chief cabinet secretaries expressing sincere remorse over the events of WWII.	在他以前，无数首相和内阁官方长官都对二战中所发生的事件表达了诚挚的忏悔。
Twenty years ago, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, the head of the Socialist Party, acknowledged that “Japan, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries,” particularly in Asia.	二十年前，时任首相、社会党党首村山富市承认“日本的殖民统治和侵略给许多国家的人民造成了严重伤害和苦难，”特别是亚洲国家。
He went on to express “feelings of deep remorse” and offer a “heartfelt apology” to the victims.	他接着表示“感到深深的忏悔”，向受害者致以“衷心的歉意”。
Ten years later, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi reiterated Murayama’s words, adding that since the war, Japan had been “manifesting its remorse for the war through actions,” especially development assistance and humanitarian activities.	十年后，小泉纯一郎首相重申了村山的歉词，并说二战结束以来日本一直在“用行动表达对战争的忏悔，”特别是发展援助和人道主义行动。
Koizumi also pledged that “Japan, as a peace-loving nation, will work to achieve peace and prosperity for all humankind with all its resources.”	小泉还承诺“日本是热爱和平的国家，将尽其所能致力于实现全人类的和平与繁荣。 ”
This intractability is, in some cases, understandable; the pain of survivors and their descendants remains acute.	从某种程度上，这个棘手问题不难理解； 幸存者及其后代的痛苦依然剧烈。
But in many other cases, the unwillingness to move beyond history is driven by political interests.	但在某些情形中，不愿抛弃历史恩怨是因为政治利益。
Indeed, political motivations are behind claims that Abe does not agree with past official apologies, despite his repeated assurances that he does, as well as suggestions that he is seeking to revise history, even though he has never denied Japan’s colonial aggression.	事实上，声称安倍不同意此前的官方道歉（尽管他一再保证他同意此前的道歉），其背后便是政治动机； 同样，认为安倍试图推翻历史（尽管他从未否认日本的殖民侵略），其背后也是政治动机。
Moreover, some have produced portrayals of Japan, as a whole, as an unrepentant country – or, worse, as one that is hell-bent on remilitarization.	此外，一些人将日本的整体形象刻画为一个冥顽不灵的国家——更有甚者，说日本铁了心要重走军国主义老路。
Such depictions are breathtaking in their audacity, given Japan’s seven-decade record as a peaceful and constructive member of the international community.	这样的描述不可不谓厚颜无耻，因为七十年来日本一直是国际社会和平而具有建设性的成员。
This is not lost on those in Japan who ask for how long their country will have to apologize, with some even suggesting that after 70 years, a “tweet” on the subject should amount to adequate acknowledgement by Abe.	对于一些质问祖国究竟需要道歉多长时间的日本人来说，这一点很重要，有人甚至认为，70年后，关于该主题的一条“推特”应该足以让安倍认识到这一点。
The prime minister, however, remains committed to issuing a strong and sincere statement on the subject.	但是，首相仍决定就该主题发表强烈而诚挚的讲话。
Early this year, Abe announced his intention to use the 70th anniversary statement to communicate Japan’s remorse for the war, describe the progress the country has made in upholding peace, and describe the contributions that Japan can make to Asia and the rest of the world in the coming decades.	今年年初，安倍宣布他将在70周年讲话中表达日本对战争的忏悔，描述日本在支持和平方面所取得的进步，并表达日本可以在未来几十年对亚洲和世界其他地区的和平所做的贡献。
In fact, it is the third component of the announcement that inspires fear in some observers: By helping to build a strong security architecture in the Asia-Pacific region, Japan could undermine the ability of some actors to advance their own interests.	事实上，第三部分引起了一些观察者的担忧：通过帮助亚太地区构建强大的安全结构，日本可能破坏某些行动方主张自身利益的能力。
That is why they launched a whisper campaign against Abe’s statement months before he even began to write it.	因此，它们用谣言攻击安倍的讲话，哪怕距离讲话时间还有几个月之久、演讲词都没有开始撰写。
But, of course, Asian security and prosperity is in everyone’s interest.	但是，亚洲的安全与繁荣当然事关所有人的利益。
Given this, not even the language of Abe’s statement is particularly important; what matters is the determination he expresses, and the actions he takes to follow through – with appropriate humility – on his pledges.	因此，即便安倍讲话的用词并非十分重要，重要的是他所表达的决心，以及他（以合适的谦逊态度）拿出怎样的行动。
And it seems that Abe is, indeed, determined to make real contributions to peace, based on effective cooperation with Japan’s friends and allies.	事实上，安倍似乎决心要在与日本友邦和盟国进行有效合作的基础上为和平做出真正的贡献。
But if Asia is to move beyond its past, the victims of Japan’s wartime aggression must recognize that the Japan of 2015 is not the Japan of 1931, 1941, or even 1945, and that, as many Asian leaders have realized over the years, forgiveness benefits everyone.	但如果亚洲要超越历史恩怨，日本战时侵略的受害者就必须承认2015年的日本不是1931、1941乃至1945年的日本，并且，如许多亚洲领导人在过去几年中所认识到的，原谅可以给所有人带来好处。
In 1998, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung responded positively to a statement by former Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.	1998年，韩国总统金大中对前日本首相小渊惠三的讲话予以积极回应。
The governments of Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and other countries have done the same, and now welcome Japan’s commitment to act with its allies to protect regional security.	印度尼西亚、菲律宾、越南和其他国家也是如此，现在它们都欢迎日本与盟国携手保护地区安全的承诺。
These countries’ openness to reconciliation have enabled Japan to recast itself as a key arbiter of regional peace and prosperity, not to mention an increasingly dynamic cultural hub.	这些国家对和解的开放态度让日本重新铸造其地区和平与繁荣重要仲裁者的形象，更不用说活力日盛的文化枢纽了。
It is time for the rest of the region to follow suit, accepting at face value Japan’s sincere apologies and working with the country to build a better future.	该地区其他国家也应该效而仿之，按字面意思接受日本诚挚的道歉，与日本共同建设更美好的未来。
At a time when Asia is facing serious security challenges, this stance could not be more urgent.	在亚洲面临严重安全挑战的当下，这一立场无比紧要。
A Big Chance for Small Farmers	小农迎来大机遇
NEW YORK – The G-8’s $20 billion initiative on smallholder agriculture, launched at the group’s recent summit in L’Aquila, Italy, is a potentially historic breakthrough in the fight against hunger and extreme poverty.	纽约——八国集团不久前在意大利拉奎拉峰会上启动的200亿美元小农援助计划或许是战胜饥饿和极端贫困的一次历史性的突破。
With serious management of the new funds, food production in Africa will soar.	如果这笔新资金能得到认真的管理，非洲的粮食生产将会大幅度增加。
Indeed, the new initiative, combined with others in health, education, and infrastructure, could be the greatest step so far toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals, the internationally agreed effort to reduce extreme poverty, disease, and hunger by half by 2015 .	实际上，这项新计划和其他医疗、教育、基础设施计划一起，有可能成为迄今为止实现千年发展目标的最有效举措，千年发展目标国际协议规定到2015年将极端贫困、疾病和饥饿人口减少到原来的半数。
During 2002-2006, I led the United Nations Millennium Project, which aimed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, for then-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.	2002至2006年，我为实现千年发展目标，在时任联合国秘书长科菲·安南管理下领导联合国千年发展项目。
One cornerstone of the project was “smallholder farmers,” meaning peasant farm families in Africa, Latin America, and Asia – working farms of around one hectare (2.5 acres) or less.	“小农”是这个项目的基础，“小农”一词是非洲、拉美和亚洲耕种土地不超过1公顷（合2. 5英亩）的农民家庭的代名词。
These are some of the poorest households in the world, and, ironically, some of the hungriest as well, despite being food producers.	颇具讽刺意味的是，尽管自身也生产粮食，但他们却隶属于世界最贫困、最饥饿家庭的行列。
They are hungry because they lack the ability to buy high-yield seeds, fertilizer, irrigation equipment, and other tools needed to increase productivity.	他们饥饿，是因为无力购买提高产量所需的高产种子、化肥、灌溉设备和其他工具。
As a result, their output is meager and insufficient for their subsistence.	这导致农作物产量匮乏，根本不够维持生计。
Their poverty causes low farm productivity, and low farm productivity reinforces their poverty.	他们的贫困造成农业生产率低下，而农业生产率低下又反过来加剧了贫困。
It’s a vicious circle, technically known as a poverty trap.	这形成了恶性循环，技术上被称为贫困陷阱。
The UN Millennium Project’s Hunger Task Force, led by two world-leading scientists, M. S. Swaminathan and Pedro Sanchez, examined how to break this vicious circle.	在两位世界著名科学家斯瓦米纳坦和佩德罗·桑切斯的领导下，联合国千年发展项目反饥饿工作组研究这种恶性循环应该如何打破。 工作组的结论是，如果以农业投入的方式向小农提供帮助，可能会大幅增加非洲粮食产量。
The Hunger Task Force determined that Africa could substantially increase its food production if help was given to smallholder farmers, in the form of agricultural inputs.  The Millennium Project recommended a big increase in global funding for this purpose.  Drawing on that work and related scientific findings, Annan launched a call in 2004 for an African Green Revolution, based on an expanded partnership between Africa and donor countries.	千年计划建议大幅度增加对这方面的全球资助。 根据此项成果及相关的科学发现，安南在扩大非洲和捐助国合作规模的基础上，在2004年呼吁启动非洲绿色革命。
Many of us, notably current UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, have worked hard to make this possible, with Ban repeatedly emphasizing the special emergency arising from the global food, financial, and energy crises of the past two years.	我们很多人，特别是现任联合国秘书长潘基文，为实现这一目标付出了艰苦的努力。 潘秘书长反复强调过去两年中全球粮食、金融和能源危机引发的特别问题。
The G-8 announcement reflects these years of effort, and of course the boost from the leadership of US President Barack Obama, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, World Bank President Robert Zoellick, European Commissioner Louis Michel, European Parliamentarian Thijs Berman, and others.	八国集团声明反映了这些年的努力，其中当然离不开美国总统巴拉克·奥巴马、西班牙总理何塞·路易斯·萨帕特罗、澳大利亚总理陆克文、世界银行行长罗伯特·佐立克、欧盟专员路易·米歇尔、欧洲议会议员蒂伊斯·伯曼、还有其他人的领导作用。
Now the key is to make this effort work.	现在的关键是要收到实效。
The lessons of history are clear.	历史的教训显而易见。
Getting seed and fertilizer to smallholder farmers at highly subsidized prices (or even free in some cases) will make a lasting difference.	向小农家庭发放含有大量补贴的种子和化肥（有时甚至是免费发放）将产生持续性效果。
Not only will food yields rise in the short term, but farm households will use their higher incomes and better health to accumulate all sorts of assets: cash balances, soil nutrients, farm animals, and their children’s health and education.	不仅能在短期内提高粮食产量，而且能使农户利用高收入和更好的医疗积累各种财富：现金盈余、土壤养分、家畜、及其子女的医疗和教育。
That boost in assets will, in turn, enable local credit markets, such as micro-finance, to begin operating.	资产的积累反过来会启动小额融资公司等当地信贷市场。
Farmers will be able to buy inputs, either out of their own cash, or by borrowing against their improved creditworthiness.	农户可以依靠自有资金或资信改善来以贷款的方式购买农用物资。
A consensus has now been reached on the need to assist smallholders, but obstacles remain.	目前已经就援助小农的必要性达成���一致，但在实际操作中还存在问题。
Perhaps the main risk is that the “aid bureaucracies” now trip over each other to try to get their hands on the $20 billion, so that much of it gets taken up by meetings, expert consultations, overhead, reports, and further meetings.	现在主要的风险或许是“官僚援助体系”竭力争夺这200亿美元的经费，想把尽可能多的部分用于会议、专家咨询、管理费用、报告撰写以及组织更多的会议。
“Partnerships” of donors can become an expensive end in themselves, merely delaying real action.	捐助国的“伙伴关系”自身又可能代价昂贵，而且除推迟实际行动外起不到任何作用。
If donor governments really want results, they should take the money out of the hands of thirty or more separate aid bureaucracies and pool it in one or two places, the most logical being the World Bank in Washington and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in Rome.	如果捐助国政府真的看重结果，就应该从30家或者更多的独立官僚援助机构中把款项收回，集中交给一两家机构管理。 最顺理成章的管理机构是华盛顿世界银行和罗马联合国国际农业发展基金。
One or both of these agencies would then have an account with several billion dollars.	这样这一两家机构就会拥有数十亿美元的扶贫账户。
Governments in hunger-stricken regions, especially Africa, would then submit national action plans that would provide details on how they would use the donor funds to get high-yield seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, farm tools, storage silos, and local advice to impoverished farmers.	饥荒地区，特别是非洲的政府，则需提交国家行动计划，提供他们打算如何利用捐助款项为贫困农民提供高产种子、化肥、灌溉、农机、仓库和咨询建议的细节。
An independent expert panel would review the national plans to verify their scientific and managerial coherence.	将由独立的专家小组对国家计划的科学性和管理的连贯性进行评估。
Assuming that a plan passes muster, the money to support it would quickly be disbursed.	如果计划通过了检验，支持计划的资金将迅速拨付到位。
Afterward, each national program would be monitored, audited, and evaluated.	而后，将对每项国家计划进行监督、审计和评估。
This approach is straightforward, efficient, accountable, and scientifically sound.	这种方法直接、有效、负责、有着不错的科学基础。
Two major recent success stories in aid have used this approach: the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunizations, which successfully gets immunizations to young children, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, which supports national action plans to battle these killer diseases.	最近两个成功的捐助案例就是使用的这种方法：其一是全球疫苗免疫联盟成功为儿童提供免疫服务，还有就是全球艾滋病、肺结核和疟疾基金为战胜上述致命疾病的国家计划提供了支持。
Both have saved millions of lives during the past decade, and have paved the way to a new more efficient and scientifically sound method of development assistance.	过去10年来这两家机构都挽救了数百万人的生命，并为更高效、更科学合理的新的发展援助方法铺平了道路。
Not surprisingly, many UN agencies and aid agencies in rich countries fight this approach.	很多联合国和富裕国家援助机构为此展开争夺，这并不值得大惊小怪。
All too often, the fight is about turf, rather than about the most effective way to speed help to the poor.	但这种争夺常常是为了争权夺利，而不是以最有效的方法向贫困人口提供援助。
Obama, Rudd, Zapatero, and other forward-thinking leaders can therefore make a huge difference by following up on their pledges at the G-8 and insisting that the aid really works.	奥巴马、陆克文、萨帕特罗和其他有远见的领导人因此可以通过兑现在八国峰会上的承诺、坚持要求实际援助效果带来巨大的变化。
The bureaucracies must be bypassed to get help to where it is needed: in the soil tilled by the world’s poorest farm families.	必须绕过官僚机构为由世界最贫困的农民家庭所耕种的土地提供援助。
A Black and White Question	黑白人种问题
NEW YORK – In the afternoon of July 16 two men appeared to be breaking into a fine house in an expensive area of Cambridge, Massachusetts.	纽约——7月16日下午两名男子看似正试图闯入位于马萨诸塞州坎布里奇高尚住宅区的一栋豪宅。
Alerted by a telephone call, a policeman arrived smartly on the scene.	接到电话报警后，一名警察立即赶到了现场。
He saw one black male standing inside the house and asked him to come out.	他看到一名黑人男子在房间里，就要求他出来。
The man refused.	那个人拒绝了。
He was then told to identify himself.	警察要求他说明身份。
The man, still refusing to step out, said he was a Harvard professor, showed his ID, and warned the cop not to mess with him.	该男子仍然拒绝走出房门，但说自己是一位哈佛教授，出示了证件，并警告警察不要打扰他。
He said something about black men in America being singled out, and asked the cop, who was white, for his name and identification.	他说美国黑人遭到歧视，并要求那位白人警察报名并出示警官证。
The cop, joined by several colleagues, arrested the professor for disorderly conduct.	此时该警察的几名同事赶到，他们以妨害治安为由逮捕了这位教授。
We now know that the professor had broken into his own home, with the help of his chauffeur, because the door was jammed.	我们现在知道这位教授在司机的帮助下闯入了自家的房门，因为门被卡住了。
What was unusual here was not the cop’s heavy-handedness.	这次事件中不同寻常的并不是警察的暴虐。
Most people in the US know that if you talk back to the police, they will get nasty very fast.	多数美国人都知道如果跟警察顶嘴，他们很快就会变得气急败坏。
The fact that the man was black might or might not have made the cop go for his handcuffs even sooner than he might normally have done.	这位教授是黑人的事实可能有也可能没有导致警察更快地掏出手铐。
That, too, would not have been unusual.	这一点也没有什么不同寻常。
What made this case special was that Henry Louis “Skip” Gates is one of the most celebrated professors in the country, famous for his books, his articles, and numerous television appearances.	这个案件的特殊性在于亨利·路易斯·盖茨是美国最著名的教授之一，著作等身，文章充栋，并多次在电视上露面。
He is a grandee, a mover and shaker in the academic and media world, a friend of President Barack Obama.	他称得上是位显贵，在学术和媒体圈中一呼百应，还与巴拉克·奥巴马总统私交甚笃。
That is why he warned the cop, Sgt. James Crowley, a veteran of the Cambridge police force, not to mess with him.	他因此警告詹姆斯·克劳利中士，这位坎布里奇的老资格警官不要招惹他。
Class and race overlap in the US.	美国的阶级和种族问题错综复杂。
In this instance, it is impossible to pry them apart.	在这个案件中，不可能将它们区分清楚。
Gates, deeply conscious, indeed a specialist of the terrible history of race relations in his country, instinctively assumed that he was a victim of prejudice.	盖茨非常了解美国糟糕的种族关系史，甚至可以说是这方面的专家，因此他本能地认为自己成了种族歧视的受害者。
From his words it appears that he was equally conscious of not getting the proper respect due to a distinguished Harvard professor and media celebrity.	从他的话中还可以看出他因未能获得一位哈佛教授兼媒体名人应有的尊重而耿耿于怀。
As he put it to his daughter in an interview published online: “[Crowley] should have gotten out of there and said, ‘I’m sorry, sir, good luck.	他在网上公布的一次采访中对自己的女儿说：“[克劳利]当时应该对我说，‘对不起，先生，祝您好运。 我喜欢您的[电视]系列片——回头见！
Loved your [television] series—check with you later!’”	’说完后立即离开。 ”
Alas, Sgt.Crowley had never heard of Professor Gates.	唉，克劳利中士从来没有听说过盖茨教授的大名。
A local man whose brothers all serve in the police force, a sports fan, and an amateur basketball coach, Crowley does not move in the same social circles as Gates.	作为一名兄弟都在警方供职的当地男性，一名体育爱好者，和一名业余篮球教练，克劳利和盖茨根本不属于同一个的社交圈。
As it happens, the charges were duly dropped, and there the case might have rested if President Obama, tired and frustrated after weeks of fighting for his healthcare bill, had not weighed in on behalf of his “friend” Gates, and called the police “stupid.”	实际上，对盖茨的指控已被及时取消，如果不是奥巴马总统在因连续几周争取通过医疗法案未果而感到厌倦和沮丧时去替“老友”盖茨说话，将警方斥之为“愚不可及”的话，这个案件可能已经烟消云散了。
Both he and Gates then spoke of “learning” from the incident.	然后他和盖茨都谈到了这次事件的“教训”。
Gates might even be planning a television documentary on racial profiling.	盖茨甚至可能正在筹划拍摄一部有关粗暴执法的电视纪录片。
One thing to be learned, if we didn’t know this already, is how close racial sensitivities are to the surface of US life, despite the election of a black president.	如果我们还没有吸取这样的教训，那么这件事的教训之一就是告诉我们尽管选出了一位黑人总统，但种族敏感问题多么容易在美国生活中浮出水面。
The complexities of black anger, white guilt, and of black, and white fear, are so vexed that most Americans prefer not to talk about race at all.	黑人的愤怒、白人的负疚、还有黑人和白人的恐惧是如此错综复杂，以致于多数美国人选择逃避种族话题。
The field is too full of mines.	这片领域里有着太多的地雷。
One of Obama’s great achievements is that he made it into a serious topic through the brilliance and subtlety of his rhetoric.	奥巴马最大的成就之一是他通过自己智慧巧妙的措辞，对绝大多数人讳莫如深的种族问题进行了严肃的探讨。
And there remains plenty to talk about: the grotesquely disproportionate number of black men in US prisons; the lack of educational opportunities in poor, mostly black areas; the appalling healthcare system; and the very real brutality used by police officers against blacks, who don’t have the privilege of a Harvard ID.	可以谈论的话题还有很多：包括美国监狱中比例畸高的黑人在押犯、穷人聚居区、绝大部分是黑人聚居区教育机会的匮乏、可怕的医疗体制、以及警官对没有哈佛身份的黑人所采用的真实的暴力行径。
It is probably true that many white policemen, even if they are trained to avoid racial profiling, as Sgt. Crowley was, need to be convinced that a black man can be at home in one of the finer houses of Cambridge, or any other American city.	也许的确需要说服像克劳利中士这样的许多白人警官，即便他们曾经接受过避免暴力执法的训练，黑人也可以居住在位于坎布里奇、或者其他任何美国城市的高尚住宅区的家中。
But is the Gates affair the right way to enter into this discussion?	如果不是盖茨教授，谁还能够引起关注？ 正因为他是名人显贵，才能吸引全国民众关注这一严重的问题。
One might argue that it	如果同样的事情发生在哈莱姆区，或另外一个主要由黑人构成的穷人聚居区内一个无名小卒的身上，那么也许根本就不会有人知道。 这次事件发生在坎布里奇教授身上才吸引了人们的注意力。
There is, however, a danger that it will have an adverse affect on the necessary national discussion about race.	但这个案件的确也存在着对有关种族的全国讨论产生负面影响的危险性。
By having made such a big issue out of what was in fact a relatively minor event Gates could be accused of trivializing much worse instances of abuse.	因为把实际上不那么重要的问题过分夸大，盖茨可能受到将比这恶劣很多的滥用职权事件琐碎化的指责。
Indeed, we don’t even know for certain whether this was such an instance.	事实上，我们根本不知道这个案件是否涉及到种族范畴。
Crowley never mentioned the color of Gates’ skin. There was no question of violence.	克劳利自始至终从未提到过盖茨的肤色，也没有出现过任何暴力侵害行为。
There were just very raw nerves and hypersensitivity to hints of disrespect, on the part of the professor, and of the cop.	只是教授和警察双方都对不尊重的暗示表现得过于敏感。
Outrage about a professor who is not to be messed with is not the best way to discuss the plight of countless, poor, anonymous people, whom most of us find it too easy to ignore.	一位不愿受到打扰的教授的怒火并非探讨无数贫困的无名人士所处困境的最佳方式，这些无名的小人物太容易被我们所忽略。
A Bollywood Bride for Sarkozy?	萨尔科奇的宝莱坞新娘
PARIS &#45;&#45; Ever since French President Nicolas Sarkozy took himself off his country’s most-eligible-bachelor list by publicly acknowledging his affair with supermodel-turned-pop-musician Carla Bruni during a romantic trip to Euro Disney, he’s run into trouble.	巴黎&#45;&#45;自从法国总统萨尔科奇在欧洲迪斯尼的浪漫之旅期间公开承认与前超级模特、流行音乐歌手布吕尼的恋情而把自己从法国最受追逐的钻石王老五名单中除下后，他就沾染上了麻烦。
His ratings have dipped below 50% for the first time.	他的民意指数第一次下降到50%以下。
Older French citizens don’t find the public spectacle of their leader in love very amusing.	上年纪的法国人并不欣赏国家领导人公开展示恋情。
Abroad, Egyptian lawmakers were so exercised over the prospect of the French head of state sharing a bed with his girlfriend that several vented their disapproval on the floor of the parliament.	在外国，几名埃及议员们对于法国国家元首同其女友同床共枕非常激动，乃至在国会上公开表示不满。
Likewise, India is all in a quandary over how to handle protocol during Sarkozy’s impending visit to the subcontinent as the guest of honor at the country’s Republic Day celebrations on January 26.	同样，印度也对如何处理萨尔科奇即将作为国家贵宾参加该国1月26日的共和国日庆祝活动的礼宾问题为难。
Should the First Girlfriend have her own motorcade, as a first lady would?	第一女友是否应当像第一夫人一样有自己的车队呢？
Meanwhile, the same hard-right Hindu groups that protest Valentine’s Day as a decadent Western holiday have warned that if Sarkozy arrives with his girlfriend in tow, they’ll be out in the streets to welcome him.	极右翼印度教团体反对情人节，认为这是腐朽堕落的西方节日。 他们警告说，如果萨尔科奇带着女朋友来访，他们就会上街欢迎。
This controversy has threatened to cast a pall over a much-heralded summit between two of the world’s great democracies.	这一争端已经威胁给大受赞扬的世界两大民主国家的峰会蒙上阴影。
With lucrative deals at stake for the big-ticket products that drive the French economy – military hardware, nuclear power plants, and Airbus planes – France has a strong interest in a successful summit in India.	推动法国经济的的军火、核电站以及空中客车等大笔利润丰厚的交易取决于这一访问，因此，对于这次成功的印度之行，法国利益攸关。
So, as rumors fly of secret marriage ceremonies either already concluded or in the works, could the trouble brewing in India over the French president’s very public love life be behind the rush to have the couple legally wed?	因此，当秘密婚礼已经完成或者正在准备的传言飞散之际，印度对于法国总统公共恋情满城风雨是否推动了二人结婚呢？
The news in Sarkozy’s favored media outlet	萨尔科奇所喜欢的&lt;&lt;星期日&gt;&gt;杂志报导说两人打算结婚引发大众猜测婚礼究竟何时举行。 二人已经交换定情物。
It’s “serious,” the smitten president admitted.	热恋中的法国总统承认这一恋情是“严肃认真”的。
But he refused, even under direct questioning by reporters, to reveal an exact date.	但是他甚至在记者的直截了当的提问下也拒绝公开确切的日期。
“You’ll probably find out after it’s happened,” he taunted.	他大声训斥说：“完事后你们也许就会知道了。
Rumor has it the couple has set February 8 or 9 for the wedding.   Others say that Sarkozy has already outsmarted the media by secretly marrying in the Elysee Palace, even as he was dodging wedding questions.	”有传言说两人已经订下2月8日或者9日结婚。 还有人说萨尔科奇在回避结婚问题的时候已经在爱丽舍宫秘密结婚而让媒体扑空。
If that is true, then Sarkozy missed the romantic opportunity of a lifetime.	如果确实如此，萨尔科奇就错过了一辈子才有一次的浪漫机会。
If the couple sizzled for cameras with Luxor and Petra as the backdrop, just imagine how hot things could get at the most romantic spot on Earth, the Taj Mahal.	如果二人以埃及祖玛和约旦佩特拉为背景在镜头前任人拍照，那么，想像一下在世界上最为浪漫的地点印度泰姬陵前将会有多么热闹。
And, given the current rage for all things Bollywood in France, a lavish Indian wedding would be fitting.	而且，鉴于法国目前对于印度的宝莱坞电影着迷，一场浪漫的印度婚礼将会再合适不过了。
Bruni’s own life path closely resembles any number of Bollywood stars who have made the transition from model to actress.	布吕尼自身的生活道路也非常像宝莱坞明星那样从模特转到演员。
A comely brunette who sings is perfect for a Bollywood makeover.	一个漂亮的褐色头发歌唱女郎对于宝莱坞化妆而言是再好不过的了。
The Indian government will be nothing if not relieved to see the first girlfriend made a wife.	印度政府如果见到第一女友成为第一夫人而不感到如释重负就无足轻重了。 印度最大的报纸之一印度快报怕有人不懂而指出，“女朋友不是妻子或配偶。
As one of India’s leading daily newspapers, the	”一旦结婚，所有有关法国代表团礼宾问题的担心都将会烟消雾散。
Despite the sometimes downright pornographic on-screen writhing of Bollywood starlets, India is still a deeply conservative society.	除了宝莱坞刚刚出道的女演员会在银幕上有一些露骨的色情折腾表演外，印度还是一个极为保守的社会。
Divorce is anathema. (Sarkozy is now twice divorced.)	离婚是丢人现眼的事情(萨尔科奇现在已经两次离婚了)。
And, while mistresses abound among the privileged classes, they do not strut publicly by their power-mates’ sides.	而且，尽管有钱有势的人周围有不少情人，但是她们并不公开出现在这些人的周围。
Kissing and fondling in public, even by spouses, is taboo.	公共场合下即使夫妻之间亲吻拥抱也是为社会所不容。
In this respect, India more resembles the France with which Sarkozy wants to make a clean break than the current one.	在这一方面，印度倒像是萨尔科奇所想要决裂的法国，而不是当前的法国。
Most Indians, as it seems many French, would prefer not to shed the “hypocrisy” Sarkozy laments on the part of his predecessors (read: former French President François Mitterrand, who had a child with his mistress about whom the public knew nothing until the man’s funeral).	在许多法国人看来，大多数印度人情愿不放下对萨尔科奇前任们的“伪善”指责(也就是，直到法国前总统密特朗葬礼时人们才知道他有一名情妇和私生女儿)。
Sarkozy, of all people, should know that a large part of the gravitas of office derives from pomp and circumstance.	萨尔科奇要比所有的人都应该知道总统职位份量的很大一部分来自于庄重和场合。
Statecraft is a realm where appearances are meant to be deceiving.	在国事活动中，外表应当是遮人耳目的。
When Sarkozy, who otherwise has such finely tuned media instincts, protests that he’s no different from any other man, he comes dangerously close to confusing the office and the person of the president.	萨尔科奇平时具有良好的媒体本能，他抱怨说他和平常人并没有什么两样。 这时候，他就危险地把总统个人和总统职务混为一谈了。
Most French people could only dream of an exotic wedding in India.	大多数法国人只能梦见在印度举办一场充满异国情调的婚礼。
Sarkozy could make that dream come true.	萨尔科奇则可以让这一梦想成为现实。
If he really is as head-over-heels in love with Bruni as he claims, and plans to marry her imminently, why not take advantage of his upcoming trip to India and make this a wedding to remember?	如果他果真像他所说的那样对布吕尼爱得死去活来而且想要大操大办与她结婚，那么为何不利用即将到来的印度之行并让这一婚礼永志不忘呢？
He could meet his bride seated majestically on the caparison of an elaborately decorated elephant, and she would look ravishing swathed and bejeweled in Indian finery.	他可以让新娘座在一头精心打扮的大象上迎接，而新娘则身著印度鲜艳服装，珠光宝气。
The “bling-bling” president, as Sarkozy has been dubbed, can wear all the gold he wants and heap yet more diamonds on his bride.	被人称为喜欢名牌服装的总统的萨尔科奇可以穿上他所想要的所有金饰并且让新娘戴上更多的钻石。
The cameras would roll, Indians would smile, and France would be treated to a Bollywood spectacle beyond its wildest dreams.	照相机会闪个不停，印度人会抱以微笑，而法国将会受到做梦也想不到的宝莱坞式的热闹场景。
And if it’s too late for the wedding, there’s always the reception.	而且，如果没有赶上婚礼，还有婚宴呢。
A Born-Again CAP	重生的共同农业政策
WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS – Born in 1957, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is now more than 50 years old, and the European Commission is proposing what it calls a health check for its middle-aged child.	瓦格宁根，荷兰——诞生于1957年的共同农业政策（CAP）如今已年逾五旬，欧盟委员会正提议对它这位中年后代进行所谓的体检。
But superficial repairs will not meet the European Union’s future needs. The CAP must be born again.	不过，表面的修补碍难满足欧盟未来的需要，共同农业政策必须转世重生。
Work on its renewal is due to start now, with the completed project ready in 2013. But a much more profound re-think is needed.	与其重生有关的工作预定即刻开始，完成的计划在2013年将可付诸实施，但我们还需对其进行一番深入得多的再思考。
The CAP’s original aim was to provide a secure source of food for the six original member states of the Union, which were importers of food and sought a degree of self-sufficiency.	共同农业政策原本旨在为欧盟最初的六个成员国提供可靠的食物来源，当时这六国是食品进口国并试图实现一定的自给自足。
Good, healthy, and cheap food had to be accessible for all citizens.	所有公民都应获得优质、健康而又廉价的食品；
Improved agricultural productivity would benefit rural areas and give farmers a comparative share in the Union’s growing wealth.	提升的农业生产率将惠及农村地区，并使农民在欧盟不断增长的财富中获得相称的一份。
Instruments to achieve those objectives were developed, and food security was achieved.	实现这些目标所需的手段得到发展，食品安全也得以实现。
The CAP quickly came to be seen as the jewel in the crown of the European project.	很快，共同农业政策就被视为欧洲计划中的皇冠上的宝石。
As the EU has evolved and expanded, food systems have become more complex, involving production, processing, supply-chain organization, and wholesale and retail distribution, with all of these involving new issues like health and the environment.	随着欧盟的演化与扩张，食品体系也变得更加复杂，这一体系不但包含了生产、加工、供应链组织以及批发和零售配销等环节，而且每一环节又涉及诸如健康、环保等新的问题；
The use of land is also receiving more serious scrutiny.	对土地的使用也受到更为认真的监控。
A 1991 study by the Netherlands Scientific Council for Governmental Policy, entitled	1991年由荷兰政府政策科学委员会进行的一次名为
Those figures were for an EU of 15 countries, so with today’s 27 members the possibilities are even greater.	这些数据还只是针对彼时只有15个成员的欧盟，如今欧盟已扩大为27国，因此其潜在可能变得更为巨大。
A Dutch analysis of land use has shown that by employing the best technical and ecological means on the best available land, substantial gains could be made in food production.	一份荷兰的土地使用分析已经表明，通过在最好的可使用土地上运用最佳的技术与生态手段，食物生产可以显著增加。
So it is not surprising that the number of farmers needed has fallen substantially.	因此，所需农民数量也已经显著减少这一点不再令人吃惊。
Viewed from the standpoint of food security and the wealth of rural areas, there is now an urgent need to revisit the CAP’s main instruments so that a new policy formula can be introduced.	从食品安全与农村地区财富状况的角度看，目前，重访共同农业政策的主要手段以引入新的政策方案的需求颇为迫切。
Perverse subsidies must be removed and recent new ones favoring products such as bio-fuels reconsidered.	不当的补贴必须取消，近来有利于生物燃料等产品的新补贴则需加以重新考虑。
The	但这一态度正有损于变化。 竞争必须加以鼓励，因为更多的农村企业活动将强化农业社群，使得农民数量减少，而农场变得更好。
A simplified CAP would encourage cleaner, more productive, and efficient agriculture.	一个简化版的共同农业政策将鼓励更为清洁、更加多产并且高效的农业。
A side benefit for the EU’s standing in the world could be that the World Trade Organization’s stalled Doha negotiations could be restarted once farmers in developing countries are assured of getting a fair deal from Europe.	对于欧盟在世界上的地位而言，此举还有一个额外益处，那就是一旦发展中国家的农民得到保证，将获得来自欧洲的公平待遇后，世界贸易组织陷于中止的多哈谈判就能重新启动。
Moreover, the CAP’s role as a motor of political and social integration in Europe could be restored once renewed policies are in place.	而且只要更新后的政策就位，共同农业政策在欧洲政治与社会整合过程中所扮演的发动机角色就能恢复。
But renewal of this sort cannot be left to global market forces, as the results might not necessarily benefit European agriculture and society.	不过此类更新不能听任全球市场力量的摆布，因为其结果可能并不一定有利于欧洲农业与社会。
If the market “misbehaves,” farmers could be reduced to poverty, leading to the neglect of large areas of Europe.	如果市场“运作失当”，农民就会陷入贫困，并导致欧洲大片地区受到忽视。
That is a real enough danger to which policymakers must give serious thought as they reform the CAP on the basis of the following five pillars.	这是决策者们根据以下五条重要原则改革共同农业政策时必须严肃加以考虑的、足够真切的危险。
1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The EU needs a knowledge and innovation policy that strengthens European agriculture’s competitiveness.	1、欧盟需要一个增强欧洲农业竞争力的知识与创新政策。
Such a policy has been successful in the Netherlands, substantially contributing to the development and power of the country’s agribusiness.	这一政策曾在荷兰取得成功，对该国农业综合企业的发展与实力贡献良多。
Ten of 21 branches of Dutch agribusiness, including horticultural seeds, ornamentals, seed potatoes, and veal, are among the top contributors to the national economy and the country’s trade balance.	荷兰农业综合企业21个分支中的10个（包括园艺育种、观赏植物、种用马铃薯与小牛肉）位列对该国经济与贸易收支平衡贡献最大的产业之中。
In the EU as a whole, a policy directed toward research programs stimulating scientific excellence and greater coherence in the European knowledge system would greatly strengthen agriculture’s competitiveness and contribute to food security and sustainable development.	欧盟作为整体而言，导向刺激科学卓越成就与欧洲知识体系内更高一致性的研究项目的政策将极大地增强农业竞争力并有助于食品安全和可持续发展。
2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Europe also needs a restructuring policy for land use.	2、欧洲也需要一个关于土地使用的重组政策。
Many structural improvement programs have been financed at the European level, but agricultural production and land use are not among them.	在欧洲层面已有许多结构性改进项目得到资助，但农业生产与土地使用却不在其中。
The development of an Agricultural Main Structure would compliment the European Ecological Main Structure.	农业主体结构的发展将补全欧洲主体生态结构。
Reforestation and the repair of natural ecosystems should also be part of a land use policy.	重新造林与自然生态系统的修复也应当被纳入土地使用政策之中。
3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A policy for European food systems would treat production, processing, distribution, logistics, and retailing in combination.	3、关于欧洲食品体系的政策应对生产、加工、分配、物流以及零售诸环节进行联合考虑。
Consumption patterns and preferences are an integral part of such systems.	消费模式与偏好也是这类体系不可或缺的一部分。
Preliminary studies by the European Science Foundation’s “Forward Look on European Food Systems” could prove useful in devising an EU-wide policy.	欧洲科学基金会所做的初步研究 ——“对欧洲食品体系的展望”将为欧盟范围的政策创制提供帮助。
4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Metropolitan agriculture in a rapidly urbanizing world can provide high-quality produce on small amounts of land.	4、在一个高速城市化的世界中，都市型农业能凭借少量的土地供应高质量的农产品。
It offers an answer to rising demand for healthy food with minimal environmental side effects.	这为如何满足对健康食品不断增长的需求，同时又对环境的副作���最小这一问题提供了一个答案。
5.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A new CAP should include a policy to safeguard Europe’s landscapes.	5、新的共同农业政策应当包含一个保护欧洲地形的方案。
But a cultural heritage should not be maintained everywhere, nor should it ignore cost.	但并非各处都应保留文化遗产，也不该忽视其成本。
And it should not be a defensive policy of the sort that tends to concentrate on poor-quality land.	同时它还不应该成为一个趋向全力聚焦于贫瘠土地的防御性政策。
These five pillars involve drastic choices, but they will probably require less money from Europe’s taxpayers, not more.	上述五条重要原则涉及到激烈的选择，但它们可能只需欧洲纳税人付出更少的资金，而非更多。
They could make a real contribution to cleaner, more productive, and efficient farming and land use, while addressing social needs.	它们将对更为清洁、更加多产并且高效的农业与土地使用做出真正的贡献，并能兼顾社会的需求。
A Breakthrough Against Hunger	突破饥饿危机
NEW YORK – Today’s world hunger crisis is unprecedentedly severe and requires urgent measures.	纽约—当今世界饥饿危机的严重程度前所未有，已是当务之急。
Nearly one billion people are trapped in chronic hunger – perhaps 100 million more than two years ago.	近十亿人在忍受着长期饥饿的煎熬—这样的人口很可能比两年前增加了一亿。
Spain is taking global leadership in combating hunger by inviting world leaders to Madrid in late January to move beyond words to action.	西班牙正在对抗饥饿方面起着全球性的领导作用。 它将邀请世界各国领导人于一月底汇聚马德里，将言语付诸行动。
With Spain’s leadership and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s partnership, several donor governments are proposing to pool their financial resources so that the world’s poorest farmers can grow more food and escape the poverty trap.	在西班牙的领导和联合国秘书长潘基文的支持下，几个捐助国政府正协商着将他们的财政资源集中起来以便让世界上最贫困的农民能够种植更多的粮食，从而摆脱贫穷的陷阱。
The benefits of some donor help can be remarkable.	捐助国的支援所带来的好处是不言而喻的。
Peasant farmers in Africa, Haiti, and other impoverished regions currently plant their crops without the benefit of high-yield seed varieties and fertilizers.	非洲、海地和其他贫困地区目前都在没有高产种子和化肥的情况下种植作物。
The result is a grain yield (for example, maize) that is roughly one-third less than what could be achieved with better farm inputs.	其结果就是粮食产量（例如玉米）比在有更好的农业投入的情况下大约要少三分之一。
African farmers produce roughly one ton of grain per hectare, compared with more than four tons per hectare in China, where farmers use fertilizers heavily.	相较于大量施用化肥的中国农民每公顷四吨的产量，非洲农民每公顷的粮食产量只有约一吨。
African farmers know that they need fertilizer; they just can’t afford it.	非洲农民知道他们需要化肥，只是买不起。
With donor help, they can.	有了捐助国的帮助，他们就能用上化肥了。
Not only do these farmers then feed their families, but they also can begin to earn market income and to save for the future.	到那时，这些农民不仅能养家糊口，还能开始赚取市场收入并为未来而储蓄。
By building up savings over a few years, the farmers eventually become creditworthy, or have enough cash to purchase vitally necessary inputs on their own.	有了几年的积蓄，这些农民最终能够成为具有银行信用的人，或者有足够的现金自行购买必需的农业投入。
There is now widespread agreement on the need for increased donor financing for small farmers (those with two hectares or less of land, or impoverished pastoralists), which is especially urgent in Africa.	现今的一个广泛共识是捐助融资对非洲小农户（拥有两公顷或以下土地，或者是贫穷的畜牧业者）的必要性和急迫性。
The UN Secretary General led a steering group last year that determined that African agriculture needs around $8 billion per year in donor financing – roughly four times the current total – with a heavy emphasis on improved seeds, fertilizer, irrigation systems, and extension training.	联合国秘书长领导的一个指导小组去年得出的结论是非洲农业每年需要约八十亿的捐助融资—大约是现有规模的四倍—而重中之重是改良的种子、化肥、灌溉系统和延伸培训。
In addition to direct help for small farms, donors should provide more help for the research and development needed to identify new high-yielding seed varieties, especially to breed plants that can withstand temporary flooding, excess nitrogen, salty soils, crop pests, and other challenges to sustainable food production.	除了对小农场的直接援助外，捐助方还应该在必需的研发方面给予更多的帮助，从而开发更多种类的新高产种子，特别是用以培育能够耐受暂时的洪涝、过量的氮、盐质土壤、害虫和其他可持续粮食生产所面临的挑战的作物。
Helping the poor with today’s technologies, while investing in future improved technologies, is the optimum division of labor.	以当今的技术帮助穷人，同时投资于未来更好的技术是最佳的分工。
This investment pays off wonderfully, with research centers such as the International Rice Research Institute and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre providing the high-yield seeds and innovative farming strategies that together triggered the Asian Green Revolution.	有了如国际水稻研究所和国际玉米及小麦研究所这些提供高产种子和创新农业战略，并共同引发了亚洲“绿色革命”的研究中心，这种投资的回报极为可观。
These centers are not household names, but they deserve to be.	这些中心并非人尽皆知，但它们的确是无名英雄。
Their scientific breakthroughs have helped to feed the world, and we’ll need more of them.	它们的科学突破帮助我们养活了全世界的人口，这样的机构应该更多一些。
Dozens of low-income, food-deficit countries, perhaps as many as 40-50, have elaborated urgent programs for increased food production by small farms, but are currently held back by the lack of donor funding.	数十个低收入、粮食赤字的国家（可能有四十到五十个）已经宣布了旨在增加小农场粮食产量的紧急计划，但却由于缺少捐助方的资金支持而力不从心。
These countries have appealed to the World Bank for financing, and the Bank made a valiant effort in 2008 to help through its new Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFCRP).	这些国家向世界银行请求融资，而该行在2008年也不遗余力地通过其新的“全球粮食危机响应计划” (GFCRP) 提供了帮助。
But the Bank does not yet have sufficient funds to meet these countries’ urgent needs, and has had to ration assistance to a small fraction of the flows that could be effectively and reliably used.	但世行资金在满足这些国家的紧急需求方面也是捉襟见肘，并不得不对援助资金进行配额限制，使得其数额相对于原本所需的可靠而有效资金量而言只是杯水车薪。
Hundreds of millions of people, in the meantime, remain trapped in hunger.	同时，近十亿人则在饥饿中挣扎。
Many individual donor countries have declared that they are now prepared to increase their financial support for smallholder agriculture, but are searching for the appropriate mechanisms to do so.	许多捐助国都各自宣称正准备增加对小型农业的资金支持，但现在正寻求一种合适的实施机制。
The current aid structures are inadequate.	目前的援助架构尚有欠缺。
The more than 20 bilateral and multilateral donor agencies for agriculture are highly fragmented and of insufficient scale individually and collectively.	二十余家双边和多边的农业援助机构则高度分散，其规模不论个体还是集体都尚显不足。
Despite the dedicated efforts of many professionals, the response to the hunger crisis remains utterly inadequate.	尽管许多专业人士付出了巨大的努力，但对饥饿危机的响应仍然远远不足。
The 2008 planting seasons came and went with much too little additional help for impoverished small farmers.	2008年的种植季节来了又去，贫穷的小农户们在此期间所获得的额外援助仍是少之又少。
African countries search endlessly, and mostly fruitlessly, for the small amounts of funding needed for their purchases of fertilizer and improved seeds.	非洲国家无尽地，也几乎无果地寻求着购买化肥和良种所需的小额资金。
My colleagues and I, serving on an advisory committee for the Spanish initiative, have recommended that donors pool their funds into a single international account, which we call the Financial Coordination Mechanism (FCM).	作为西班牙政府此项计划的顾问委员会成员，我和我的同事们建议捐助方将他们的资金集中到同一个被我们称为“融资协调机制(FCM)”的国际账户。
These pooled funds would enable farmers in poor countries to obtain the fertilizer, improved seed varieties, and small-scale irrigation equipment that they urgently need.	这些集中起来的资金能让贫穷国家的农民获得急需的化肥、良种和小型灌溉设备。
Poor countries would receive prompt and predictable financing for agricultural inputs from a single account, rather than from dozens of distinct and fragmented donors.	穷国能从一个统一账户而不是数十个各自为政且高度分散的捐助方获得即时和可预见的农业投入融资。
By pooling financial resources into a single-donor FCM, aid programs’ administrative costs could be kept low, the availability of aid flows could be assured, and poor countries would not have to negotiate 25 times in order to receive help.	通过将财政资源集中到一个统一的捐助方FCM，可以保持较低的援助计划行政成本，援助资金流的持续性也能得到保证，而穷国也不必为了获得援助而进行二十五次谈判。
The time for business as usual is over.	按部就班的时代一去不返。
The donors promised to double aid to Africa by 2010, but are still far off track.	捐助方承诺到2010年将援助资金增加一倍，但现在仍是任重道远。
Indeed, during the past 20 years, they actually cut aid for agriculture programs, and only now are reversing course.	的确，在过去的二十年里，他们实际上削减了农业计划的援助资金，直到现在才开始回到正轨。
Meanwhile, a billion people go hungry each day.	与此同时，十亿人却每天生活在饥饿的阴影之中。
We need a breakthrough that is demonstrable, public, clear, and convincing, that can mobilize the public’s hearts and minds, and that can demonstrate success.	我需要一种突破，它具有示范效应，公开、明晰并具有说服力； 它能激发公众的身心投入，并彰显成功。
History can be made in Madrid at the end of January, when the world’s richest and poorest countries converge to seek solutions to the global hunger crisis.	当世界上最富裕和最贫穷的国家在一月底齐心协力寻求全球饥饿危机的解决之道时，我们就能在马德里创造历史。
The lives of the billion poorest people depend on it.	十亿最贫穷人口的生命皆系于此。
A Breakthrough Opportunity for Global Health	全球卫生状况的突破性机会
NEW YORK – Every year, millions of people die from preventable and treatable diseases, especially in poor countries.	纽约—每年都有数百万人因可防可治的疾病而身亡，特别是在穷国。
In many cases, lifesaving medicines can be cheaply mass-produced, but are sold at prices that block access to those who need them.	在很多情形中，救命药可以以低廉的成本大量生产，但售价却让需要者望而却步。
And many die simply because there are no cures or vaccines, because so little of the world’s valuable research talent and limited resources is devoted to addressing the diseases of the poor.	更有许多人的死仅仅是因为缺少治疗或疫苗，而造成这种情况的原因是用于为穷人治病的世界宝贵研究人才和有限资源太少。
This state of affairs represents a failure of economics and law that urgently needs to be corrected.	如此状况反映了经济学和法律方面急需得到修正的失灵。
The good news is that there are now opportunities for change, most promisingly through an international effort headed by the World Health Organization that would begin to fix the broken intellectual-property regime that is holding back the development and availability of cheap drugs.	好消息是现在改变的机会已现，主要是通过一项由世界卫生组织牵头的国际计划，该计划将开始修正造成廉价药品开发和难以获得问题的知识产权制度漏洞。
Two main problems limit the availability of medicines today.	如今，药品之所以难以获得，主要是拜两大问题所赐。
One is that they are very costly; or, more accurately, the price charged for them is very high, though the cost of producing them is but a fraction of that amount.	其中之一是药品成本太高； 或者，更正确地说，是药品要价太高，而生产成本只是要价的一小部分。
Second, drug development is geared toward maximizing profit, not social benefit, which skews efforts directed at the creation of medicines that are essential to human welfare.	第二个问题是药品开发的着眼点是利润最大化，而不是社会效益最大化，这使得药品开发倾向于创造对人类福利至关重要的品种。
Because the poor have so little money to spend, drug companies, under current arrangements, have little incentive to do research on the diseases that afflict them.	而穷人根本没有多少钱可花，因此，在现有安排下，制药公司根本没什么激励研究折磨穷人的疾病。
It doesn’t have to be this way.	事情本不必如此。
Drug companies argue that high prices are necessary to fund research and development.	制药公司指出，要价高是必要的，这是为了给研发提供资金。
But, in the United States, it is actually the government that finances most health-related research and development – directly, through public support (National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation), and indirectly, through public purchases of medicine, both in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.	但是，在美国，大部分卫生相关研发活动的实际出资者是政府——或是通过公共支持（美国国家卫生研究院、国家科学基金会等）直接提供资金，或是通过药品公共采购（如医疗保险和医疗补助计划）间接提供资金。
Even the part that is not government-financed is not a conventional market; most individuals’ purchases of prescription medicines are covered by insurance.	不能获得政府融资的部分也不是传统市场； 许多个人的处方药支出都能获得保险赔付。
Government finances health-care research because improved medicines are a public good.	政府之所以为卫生研究提供融资，是因为改善药品是一种公共品。
The resulting knowledge benefits everyone by stopping epidemics and limiting the economic and human toll of widespread illness.	由此带来的知识进步能防止传染病、减轻常见病的经济和人身伤害，从而让每个人都受益。
Efficiency requires sharing research as widely as possible as soon as it is available.	要获得高效，就必须在获得知识进步后尽可能快地共享之。
Thomas Jefferson compared knowledge to candles: when one is used to light another, it does not diminish the light of the first.	托马斯·杰斐逊曾将知识比作蜡烛：用一根蜡烛点燃另一根蜡烛，并不会减弱前一根蜡烛的光辉。
On the contrary, everything becomes brighter.	相反，这样能使所有东西都变得更亮。
Yet, in America and most of the world, drug prices are still exorbitant and the spread of knowledge is tightly limited.	但是，在美国以及世界大部分地区，药品价格依然高得离谱，知识的传播则受到了严格的制约。
That is because we have created a patent system that gives innovators a temporary monopoly over what they create, which encourages them to hoard their knowledge, lest they help a competitor.	这是因为我们所创造的专利制度给了创新者对其所创之物的暂时垄断权，这促使创新者对知识敝帚自珍，唯恐助了竞争者一臂之力。
While this system does provide incentives for certain kinds of research by making innovation profitable, it allows drug companies to drive up prices, and the incentives do not necessarily correspond to social returns.	这一制度使得创新有利可图，从而确实为某些类型的研究提供了激励； 但制药公司也因此得以坐地起价，它们获得的激励与社会回报不一定相容。
In the health-care sector, it may be more profitable to devote research to a “me-too” drug than to the development of a treatment that really makes a difference.	在卫生领域，致力于研究“仿造”药可能比开发一种另辟蹊径的疗法更加有利可图。
The patent system may even have adverse effects on innovation, because, while the most important input into any research is prior ideas, the patent system encourages secrecy.	专利制度甚至可能对创新起到反作用，因为研究的最重要输入变量是领先的思想，而专利制度却在鼓励彼此保密。
A solution to both high prices and misdirected research is to replace the current model with a government-supported prize fund.	要价高企和研究��向偏差问题的解决之道是用政府奖励基金代替现有模式。
With a prize system, innovators are rewarded for new knowledge, but they do not retain a monopoly on its use.	在奖励制度下，创新者将因新知识而受到奖赏，但不再获得新知识使用的垄断权。
That way, the power of competitive markets can ensure that, once a drug is developed, it is made available at the lowest possible price – not at an inflated monopoly price.	这样一来，竞争性市场的力量将能保证只要药品被开发出来，就能以尽可能低的价格（而不是大大膨胀的垄断价）为患者所获。
Fortunately, some US lawmakers are taking a strong interest in this approach.	幸运的是，一些美国立法者已对这一方法产生了浓厚兴趣。
The Prize Fund for HIV/AIDS Act, a congressional bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders, is just such an initiative.	参议员桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）提出、并获得国会通过的艾滋病奖励基金法（Prize Fund for HIV/AIDS Act）只是一个开始。
His bill also contains an important provision aimed at encouraging open-source research, which would move the current research model away from secrecy toward sharing.	桑德斯的法案包括了一个旨在鼓励开源研究的重要部分，将促使现有研究模式从保密转向共享。
But, globally, our innovation system needs much bigger changes.	但是，从全球角度看，我们的创新制度还需要做出大得多的变化。
The WHO’s efforts to encourage broad reforms at the international level are crucial.	世界卫生组织旨在促进国际层面的广泛改革的努力非常关键。
This spring, the WHO released a report that recommends solutions similar to those proposed in the US Senate bill, but on a global level.	今年春天，世界卫生组织公布了一份报告，其中提出了一项类似于桑德斯法案的解决之道——只不过世卫组织的方案是全球水平的。
Importantly, the report, “Research and Development to Meet Health Needs in Developing Countries,” recommends a comprehensive approach, including mandatory funding contributions from governments for research on developing countries’ health needs; international coordination of health-care priorities and implementation; and a global observatory that would monitor where needs are greatest.	有一点很重要，这份题为《用研发满足发展中国家的卫生需要》（“Research and Development to Meet Health Needs in Developing Countries）给出了一个完整的方法，包括来自政府的指令性发展中国家卫生研究资金分配； 优先卫生项目和实施的国际合作；
In late May, the international community will have a chance to begin implementing these ideas at the WHO World Health Assembly – a moment of hope for public health around the world.	以及监测最紧迫需求的全球观察组。 5月底，国际社会将由机会在世界卫生组织大会上开始实施这些想法，这将是世界公共卫生的希望时刻。
Reforming our innovation system is not just a matter of economics.	改革创新制度并不仅仅是一个经济问题。
It is, in many cases, a matter of life and death.	在很多情况下，它是个事关生死的大问题。
It is therefore essential to de-link R&amp;D incentives from drug prices, and to promote greater sharing of scientific knowledge.	因此，将研发激励与药品价格脱钩、鼓励更多的科学知识分享至关重要。
For America, the Sanders bill marks important progress.	对美国来说，桑德斯法案是一次重大进步。
For the world, the WHO’s recommendations represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity to remedy a long-standing and egregious inequity in health care, and, more broadly, to set a model for governance of global public goods befitting an era of globalization.	对全世界来说，世卫组织的建议可谓修正长期存在的卫生不平等性恶疾的千载难逢的良机（从更广的角度讲，也是设立与全球化时代相适应的全球公共品治理新模式的良机）。
We cannot afford to let this opportunity pass us by.	我们决不能坐视这个机会从手中白白溜走。
Absent-Minded Killers	心不在焉的杀戮者
As a species, human beings have a major self-control problem.	作为一个物种，人类存在很大的自我控制问题。
We humans are now so aggressively fishing, hunting, logging, and growing crops in all parts of the world that we are literally chasing other species off the planet.	我们人类现在全世界所有的地方如此大肆捕鱼、打猎、采伐和种植作物，乃至我们实际上在把其他物种从地球上驱赶出去。
Our intense desire to take all that we can from nature leaves precious little for other forms of life.	我们极度想要从大自然中索取所有我们可以索取的东西，留给其他生物种类的东西少之又少。
In 1992, when the world’s governments first promised to address man-made global warming, they also vowed to head off the human-induced extinction of other species.	在1992年世界各国政府第一次保证解决人为全球气候变暖的时候，他们同时还誓言阻止由人类引发的其他物种的灭绝。
The Convention on Biological Diversity, agreed at the Rio Earth Summit, established that “biological diversity is a common concern of humanity.”	在里约热内卢通过的生物多样性公约确认“生物多样性是人类的共同关切问题。
The signatories agreed to conserve biological diversity, by saving species and their habitats, and to use biological resources (e.g., forests) in a sustainable manner.	”签署国们同意通过挽救物种及其栖息地来保全生物多样性，并且以可持续的方式使用生物资源(例如森林)。
In 2002, the treaty’s signatories went further, committing to “a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss” by 2010.	2002年，该公约的签署国们更进一步，承诺在2010年以前“大幅度削减目前的生物多样性损失”。
Unfortunately, like so many other international agreements, the Convention on Biological Diversity remains essentially unknown, un-championed, and unfulfilled.	不幸的是，就像其他如此众多的国际公约一样，生物多样性公约基本上不为人所知，没有得到宣传促进，也没有得到落实。
That neglect is a human tragedy.	这一疏忽是人类的悲剧。
For a very low cash outlay – and perhaps none at all on balance – we could conserve nature and thus protect the basis of our own lives and livelihoods.	只需要很少的现金投入，甚至在根本上不需要花钱，我们就本能够保全自然，并且进而保护人类自身生命和生计的基础。
We kill other species not because we must, but because we are too negligent to do otherwise.	我们并非是出于必须才杀戮其他物种，而是我们过于疏忽，乃至不改弦更张。
Consider a couple of notorious examples.	让我们来看一看几个臭名昭著的例子。
Some rich countries, such as Spain, Portugal, Australia, and New Zealand, have fishing fleets that engage in so-called “bottom trawling.”	像西班牙、葡萄牙、澳大利亚以及新西兰等富国拥有从事所谓“水底拖网”的捕鱼船队。
Bottom trawlers drag heavy nets over the ocean bottom, destroying magnificent, unexplored, and endangered marine species in the process.	水底拖网在海洋底部拖走很重的鱼网，从而在这一过程中摧毁大量没有探明并且受到威胁的海洋物种。
Complex and unique ecologies, most notably underground volcanoes known as seamounts, are ripped to shreds, because bottom trawling is the “low cost” way to catch a few deep sea fish species.	因为水底拖网是捕捞某些深海鱼种的“低成本”办法，因此某些复杂而又独特的生态、最为主要的是被称为海底山的地下火山被切断。
One of these species, orange roughy, has been caught commercially for only around a quarter-century, but already is being fished to the point of collapse.	其中的一个物种叫做橙连鳍鲑，被用于商业捕捞不过大约25年的时间，但是已经被捕捞得处于崩溃的边缘。
Likewise, in many parts of the world, tropical rainforest is being cleared for pasture land and food crops.	同样在世界许多地方，热带雨林遭到砍伐来开辟牧场和粮食作物。
The result is massive loss of habitat and destruction of species, yielding a tiny economic benefit at a huge social cost.	结果就是栖息地的大量损失和物种的毁灭，所产生的微小的经济利益是以巨大的社会成本为代价的。
After cutting down a swath of rainforest, soils are often quickly leached of their nutrients so that they cannot sustain crops or nutritious grasses for livestock.	在一片雨林被砍伐后，土壤通常马上就丧失了养分， 无法供养作物或者让家畜食用有营养的草地。
As a result, the new pasture land or farmland is soon abandoned, with no prospect for regeneration of the original forest and its unique ecosystems.	结果，新的牧场或农田马上被放弃，没有机会再退耕还林，恢复其独特的生态系统。
Because these activities’ costs are so high and their benefits so low, stopping them would be easy.	由于这些活动的代价高昂、收益低下，停止这些活动是容易的。
Bottom trawling should simply be outlawed; it would be simple and inexpensive to compensate the fishing industry during a transition to other activities.	水底拖网应当干脆被取缔； 在捕鱼产业向其他活动转型期间予以补偿是容易做到而且也是费用不大的。
Forest clearing, on the other hand, is probably best stopped by economic incentives, perhaps combined with regulatory limits.	另一方面，砍伐森林最好通过经济激励的方式辅之以管治限制予以制止。
Simply restricting the practice of land clearing probably would not work, since farm families and communities would face a strong temptation to evade legal limits.	简单地限制开发土地的做法可能无法奏效，因为农业家庭和社区将会面临极大的躲避法律限制的诱惑。
On the other hand, financial incentives would probably succeed, because cutting down forest to create pastureland is not profitable enough to induce farmers to forego payments for protecting the land.	在另一方面，财政刺激可能会成功，因为砍伐森林来创造牧场土地并不有利可图，从而使得农民为了保护土地而放弃付款。
Many rainforest countries have united in recent years to suggest the establishment of a rainforest conservation fund by the rich countries, to pay impoverished small farmers a small amount of money to preserve the forest.	许多雨林国家在最近几年中联合起来提议富有国家建立雨林储存基金，用来向贫困的小农场主支付少量金额来保护森林。
A well-designed fund would slow or stop deforestation, preserve biodiversity, and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide the burning of cleared forests.	一个设计合理的基金将会放缓或者停止森林采伐，保护生物多样性，并且减少燃烧砍伐后的森林所造成的二氧化碳排放。
At the same time, small farmers would receive a steady flow of income, which they could use for micro-investments to improve their household’s wealth, education, and health.	与此同时，小农场主将会得到稳定的收入，他们可以用这笔钱作小额投资用以改善家庭的财富、教育和健康。
Aside from banning bottom trawling and establishing a global fund for avoided deforestation, we should designate a global network of protected marine areas, in which fishing, boating, polluting, dredging, drilling, and other damaging activities would be prohibited.	除了取缔水底拖网并且建立为避免森林砍伐的全球性基金外，我们应当指定一个全球性的海洋保护区域网络，在这些区域中禁止捕鱼、划船、污染、挖泥、钻探以及其他有害的活动。
Such areas not only permit the regeneration of species, but also provide ecological benefits that spill over to neighboring unprotected areas.	这些区域不仅可以重新恢复物种，而且还可以提供生态效益向邻近的未保护区域扩散。
We also need a regular scientific process to present the world with the evidence on species abundance and extinction, just as we now have such a process for climate change.	我们还需要定期的科学进程来向世界展示物种繁荣和灭绝的证据，正如有关气候变化的进程一样。
Politicians don’t listen very well to individual scientists, but they are forced to listen when hundreds of scientists speak with a united voice.	政客们并不十分听取个别科学家的意见，但是当几百个科学家异口同声的时候他们就不得不���取了。
Finally, the world should negotiate a new framework no later than 2010 to slow human-induced climate change.	最后，各国应该在不迟于2010年谈判一项新的框架来减缓人为引起的气候变化。
There can be little doubt that climate change poses one of the greatest risks to species’ viability.	毫无疑问，气候变化是物种生存最大的威胁之一。
As the planet warms, and rain and storm patterns change dramatically, many species will find themselves in climate zones that no longer support their survival.	当地球变暖、 降雨和风暴模式大幅度改变之际，许多物种都会处于不再支持其存活的气候区域内。
Some can migrate, but others (such as polar bears) are likely to be driven to extinction unless we take decisive action to head off climate change.	某些物种可以迁徙，但是，除非我们采取决定性的行动来阻止气候变化，其他的物种(例如北极熊)就有可能遭到灭绝。
These measures are achievable by 2010.	在2010年以前实现这些目标是可能的。
They are affordable, and in each case would ultimately deliver large net benefits.	它们在经济上是可以承担的，而且在各个情况下都最终会带来巨大的净效益。
Most importantly, they would allow us to follow through on a global promise.	最为重要的是，这将会让我们实现全球性的许诺。
It is too painful to believe that humanity would destroy millions of other species – and jeopardize our own future – in a fit of absent-mindedness.	人类在心不在焉之际会摧毁数以白万计的其他物种并威胁到我们自己的未来，要相信这一点是过于痛苦的。
Making Do With More	多劳应多得
BERKELEY – In the United States, just three out of ten workers are needed to produce and deliver the goods we consume.	伯克利—在美国，生产和递送我们所消费的商品只需要十分之三的工人。
Everything we extract, grow, design, build, make, engineer, and transport – down to brewing a cup of coffee in a restaurant kitchen and carrying it to a customer's table – is done by roughly 30% of the country's workforce.	我们提炼、种植、设计、建造、制作、打磨和运送的所有东西——一直到从饭店厨房泡一杯咖啡并送给餐桌前的顾客——是由大约30%的美国劳动力做的。
The rest of us spend our time planning what to make, deciding where to install the things we have made, performing personal services, talking to each other, and keeping track of what is being done, so that we can figure out what needs to be done next.	我们其他人把时间花在规划制造什么、决定把我们造出来的东西摆在哪里、履行个人服务、彼此谈话、追踪正在制造什么上，以便我们能够发现我们下一步需要做什么。
And yet, despite our obvious ability to produce much more than we need, we do not seem to be blessed with an embarrassment of riches.	而尽管我们显然拥有制造比我们需要的多得多的东西的能力，但我们似乎并不会富得发慌。
One of the great paradoxes of our time is that workers and middle-class households continue to struggle in a time of unparalleled plenty.	现时代的一大悖论正是工人和中产阶级家庭在前无古人的丰裕时代仍然要为生活奔波。
We in the developed countries have more than enough to cover our basic needs.	我们发达国家的人要想满足基本需要易如反掌。 我们有的是有机碳氢键，打破它们就能 给我们带来卡路里；
We have enough organic carbon-hydrogen bonds to break to provide us with calories; enough vitamins and other nutrients to keep us healthy; enough shelter to keep us dry; enough clothing to keep us warm; enough capital to keep us, at least potentially, productive; and enough entertainment to keep us from being bored.	我们有的是维生素和其他营养物质帮助我们保持健康； 我们有的是居所让我们保持干燥；
And we produce all of it for an average of less than two hours a day of work outside the home.	我们有的是娱乐项目让我们不至于无聊。 我们生产所有这些，只需要平均每天花不到两小时走出家门去工作。
John Maynard Keynes was not off by much when he famously predicted in 1930 that the human race's “economic problem, the struggle for subsistence," was likely to be “solved, or be at least within sight of solution, within a hundred years."	1930年，当凯恩斯的著名预言预测人类的“经济问题，即生存斗争”有可能“在一百年内得到解决，或至少看到解决办法。
It will take another generation, perhaps, before robots have completely taken over manufacturing, kitchen work, and construction; and the developing world looks to be 50 years behind. But Keynes would have been spot on had he targeted his essay at his readers' great-great-great-great grandchildren.	”
And yet there are few signs that working- and middle-class Americans are living any better than they did 35 years ago.	然而没有什么迹象表明美国工人和中产阶级比35年前生活得更好。
Even stranger, productivity growth does not seem to be soaring, as one would expect; in fact, it seems to be decelerating, according to research by John Fernald and Bing Wang, economists in the Economic Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.	更奇怪的是，生产率增长似乎没有如你预期的那样大幅加速； 事实上，根据旧金山联邦储备银行经济研究部的约翰·费纳尔多（John Fernald）和王兵（音）的研究，生产率增长出现了减速。
Growth prospects are even worse, as innovation hits gale-force headwinds.	增长前景甚至更加糟糕，因为创新活动撞上了南墙。
One way to reconcile the changes in the job market with our lived experience and statistics like these is to note that much of what we are producing is very different from what we have made in the past.	一个协调就业市场变化与我们的生活经验和这些统计数字的办法是注意到我们生产的许多东西与我们过去所制造的东西区别很大。
For most of human experience, the bulk of what we produced could not be easily shared or used without permission.	在人类历史的大部分时间里，我们生产出来的东西无法轻易地在未经允许的情况下共享或使用。
The goods we made were what economists call “rival" and “excludible" commodities.	我们以前制造的东西是经济学家所谓的“竞争性”或“排他性”商品。
Being “rival" means that two people cannot use the same product at the same time.	“竞争性”是指两个人无法在同时使用同一个产品。
Being “excludible" means that the owner of a product can easily prevent others from using it.	“排他性”是指产品的所有者可以轻易地阻止其他人使用这个产品。
These two traits put a great deal of bargaining power in the hands of those who control production and distribution, making them ideal for a market economy based on private property.	这两个特征让控制生产和分配的人拥有了巨大的议价权，成为基于私人产权的市场经济的理想之选。
Money naturally flows to where utility and value are being provided – and those flows are easy to track in national accounts.	钱自然而然地流向了提供效用和价值的地方——并且这些资金流可以轻易地在国民账户中进行追踪。
But much of what we are producing in the information age is neither rival nor excludible – and this changes the entire picture.	但我们在信息时代所生产的许多东西既不具有竞争性，也不具有排他性——这改变了整个局面。
The creation of information-age goods is difficult to incentivize; their distribution is hard to monetize; and we lack the tools to track them easily in national accounts.	信息时代商品的制造很难施加激励； 它们的分配也难以货币化；
The result is an ever-growing discrepancy between what people would be willing to pay for a given service and growth as measured in national statistics.	我们也缺乏工具在国民账户中轻易地追踪它们。 结果是人们愿意为给定服务所支付的数量与国民统计所测量的增长之间的差异越来越大。
In other words, we are producing and consuming much more than our economic indicators suggest – and the creators of many of those products are not being adequately compensated.	换句话说，我们生产和消费的数量比经济指标所显示的规模大得多——而许多这些产品的额制造者没有获得充分的报偿。
This produces a set of unique problems.	这就带来了一系列独特的问题。
To ensure that the workers of today and tomorrow are able to capture the benefits of the information age will require us to redesign our economic system to stimulate the creation of these new types of commodities.	为了确保今天和明天的工人能够获得信息时代的好处，我们就必须重新设计经济制度以刺激这些新型商品的创造。
In addition to developing ways to account for this new type of wealth, we will have to develop channels through which demand for a product contributes to the income of its creator.	除了找到记录这一新型财富的方法，我们还需要找到将让产品需求有利于创造者收入的渠道。
Only by finding ways to put true value on the goods we produce will we be able to sustain a middle-class society, rather than one of techno-plutocrats and their service-sector serfs.	只有找到能准确衡量我们所制造的商品的额价值的方法，我们才能维持中产阶级社会，而不至于出现由技术大亨和他们的服务业农奴组成的社会。
The New Brain Drain in Science	科研领域新一轮人才流失
DUBAI – In December 2013, the Nobel laureate physicist Peter Higgs told The Guardian that if he were seeking a job in academia today, “I don’t think I would be regarded as productive enough.”	迪拜——2013年12月，诺贝尔物理学奖得主彼得·希格斯在接受卫报采访时表示，如果他今天在学术界求职，“我恐怕不会被认为是最高效的。
Having published fewer than ten papers since his groundbreaking work in 1964, Higgs believes that no university would employ him nowadays.	”因为在1964年发表突破之作后迄今为止仅发表过不到十篇论文，希格斯认为今天没有哪家大学会雇佣他。
Academics are well acquainted with the notion of “publish or perish.”	“出版或者毁灭”是当今学者熟悉的概念。
They must publish their work in peer-reviewed journals increasingly often to climb the career ladder, protect their jobs, and secure funding for their institutions.	他们必须越来越多地在同行评议杂志上发表作品，才能攀登职业阶梯、保住工作岗位和为所在机构争取研究经费。
But what happens to scientists and other scholars, such as those in the Middle East, who have different research concerns from – and scant connections to – the professional journals that can make or break an academic/scientific career?	但那些研究重点迥异且与今天能造就或毁灭学术/科研生涯的专业期刊鲜有联系的科学家和其他学者（比方说中东学者）又该怎么办？
Scholars and institutions with high publishing rates in the established journals receive better productivity scores, which translate into bigger rewards, in terms of enhanced careers and greater research funding.	在著名期刊拥有高出版率的学者和科研机构效率得分较高，进而在职业生涯发展和研究经费支持方面得到更多奖励。
Whether the work they are publishing has a measurable impact on their field of study is, sadly, too often a secondary concern.	但可悲的是，他们所发表的作品对所在研究领域能否产生可以度量的影响却往往不那么被外界关注。
The incentives they face mean that quantity often comes before quality.	他们所面临的激励机制意味着数量往往比质量重要。
Academic journals determine the various disciplinary rankings that academic institutions are compelled to climb, which leads institutions to hire and retain only those scholars who can produce at high rates.	学术期刊决定科研机构被动研究的学科领域排名，从而导致科研机构仅仅雇佣并保留那些高效率的学者。
This has given rise to a deeper, twofold problem: academic journals have become disproportionately influential, and they have placed a premium on empirical research.	由此导致了更深层次的双重问题：学术期刊的影响力已经过于庞大，而且它们过分鼓励实证研究。
With respect to the first problem, journals are gradually replacing institutions as the arbiters of quality within academic communities.	在第一个问题上，期刊正逐步取代科研机构成为学术成果质量的评判者。
Scholars in almost any discipline seeking jobs at “A-level” institutions must publish in a select few A-level journals that are seen as gateways.	几乎任何领域想在“A级”研究机构求职的学者都必须在几本被公认为入门通道的A级杂志上发表研究成果。
These journals’ editorial boards increasingly privilege positivist theoretical work – meaning research that is based on empirical data analysis.	上述期刊的编辑委员会越来越偏爱实证主义理论研究作品——也就是说以实证数据分析为基础的研究。
Qualitative research – such as ethnographies, participatory surveys, and case studies – is often designated as suitable only for B- and C-level journals.	定性研究——如民族志、参与性调查和案例研究等——往往被定性为只适合B级或C级期刊发表。
Academics conducting empirical research have a big advantage over those carrying out qualitative work, because they can use efficient software and powerful computers to test their hypotheses quickly and account for different variables in data sets.	相比那些从事定性研究的学者，从事实证研究的学者优势非常显著。 因为他们可以使用高效软件和功能强大的电脑来快速测试假设，并计算数据集中不同变量的影响。
This kind of work can be cheaper, too, because a single data set can generate multiple journal articles.	此类工作也可以降低成本，因为单个数据集可以产出多篇期刊文章。
To be sure, there is nothing wrong with scientific practices evolving along with technology, or with academics using richer data sets and better software.	可以肯定，科学实践随技术演进、抑或学术界使用更丰富的数据集和更先进的软件都属于正常现象。
But adoption of this quantitative approach should not be the single most important criterion for assessing scientific excellence and deciding career trajectories.	但这种定量方法的采用不应成为评估科学卓越性和决定职业轨迹的唯一重要的衡量指标。
After all, knowledge is acquired in different ways, and empirical positivism is only one method in a larger epistemological inventory.	毕竟知识是以不同方式取得的，而经验实证主义仅仅是广义认识论宝库中的一项法则。
The positivist trend in science today is particularly problematic for developing countries, where data sets are scarce and often of poor quality.	今天的实证主义趋势对发展中国家而言问题尤为严重，因为发展中国家不仅数据集稀缺，而且往往质量较差。
Thus, scientists working in developing countries face a dilemma: either work on rich-world problems for which there is abundant data, or risk career advancement by conducting qualitative work that will not make it into A-level journals.	因此，在发展中国家工作的科学家们面临着囚徒困境：或者研究有着丰富数据的富裕国家问题，或者甘冒职业生涯之险而进行无缘进入A级期刊的定性研究。
Academics who move from data-rich countries in Europe and North America to data-poor countries in the Middle East and elsewhere often face this problem.	从欧洲和北美等数据丰富国家迁往中东等数据贫乏国家的学者往往面临着这样的问题。
As researchers at my institution in Abu Dhabi know, conducting surveys for qualitative research is feasible; but generating rich data from scratch for theory-building research is extremely difficult.	正如阿布扎比我所在科研机构的研究人员所知的那样，采集调研数据用于进行定性研究尚属可行； 但从零开始搜集理论建设研究所需的丰富数据却是极其困难的。
At the International Conference on Science and Technology Indicators this year, a French academic researching soil in Africa reported that only 5% of the published work in his field has originated from African researchers.	在今年召开的科学技术指标国际���议上，一位研究非洲土壤的法国学者报告在他所研究的领域，仅有5%的出版作品来自非洲研究者。
When he dug deeper into his own research, he found that 50% of what he had learned about African soil came from African researchers, who have not or could not publish their work in international academic journals.	但当他深入研究自己的研究成果时，却发现他对非洲土壤的认识有50%来自非洲研究者，而这些研究人员的成果没有也不可能在国际学术期刊上发表。
Countries where English is not the lingua franca are particularly disadvantaged in science, not because they lack academic excellence, but because English-language journals call the shots.	英语不是通用语的国家在科研方面处境尤其不利，这绝非因为他们学术科研水平不高，而是因为科学界由英语期刊来扮演发号施令的角色。
Non-English academic journals simply do not command the same attention in the science community.	非英语学术期刊在科学界根本得不到同样的关注。
As a result, the scope of research topics that many countries can undertake is limited, and they must struggle to retain scientific talent.	结果导致许多国家可以进行的研究课题范围有限，因此必须拼尽全力才能将科研人才留在本国。
This is particularly true in the Middle East, where governments are struggling to diversify their economies, in order to make them more resilient.	中东地区的情况尤其如此，各国政府正努力实现经济多样化，从而使国民经济适应性得到提高。
As English-language empirical-research journals consolidate their hold on the channels that determine whether or not a scientist will have a successful career, developing countries will have to invest heavily in their own data infrastructure to place domestic researchers on a more competitive footing.	因为英语实证研究期刊进一步增强了对科学家能否取得职业成功渠道的控制，发展中国家必须大量投资于国内数据基础设施，才能使国内研究人员处在更具竞争力的科研地位上。
But even – or especially – if developing countries do make such investments, much will be lost to science.	但即使——或者尤其——如果发展中国家确实进行这样的投资，将给科研领域造成非常严重的后果。
With (mostly) United States-based academic journals reigning over global science, no one has to move to become part of a new brain drain, whereby scientists’ research priorities, problems, and methods gravitate to the dominant positivist epistemology, at the expense of all alternatives.	因为统治全球科学的学术期刊（多数）来自美国，科学家不用实际迁移就会成为新人才流失的组成部分，科学家的研究重点、问题和方法将会牺牲其他选择而转向目前占主导地位的实证主义认识研究。
Polluters Must Pay	污染者必须负责
NEW YORK – When BP and its drilling partners caused the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, the United States government demanded that BP finance the cleanup, compensate those who suffered damages, and pay criminal penalties for the violations that led to the disaster.	发自纽约——当英国石油公司及其搭档瑞士越洋钻探公司于2010年在墨西哥湾引发“深水地平线”漏油事故时，美国政府不但要求英国石油公司承担油污清理费用，赔偿受害者损失，还要为导致此次灾难的违规行为接受刑事处罚。
BP has already committed more than $20 billion in remediation and penalties.	英国石油公司已经为该事故调拨了200多亿美元用于善后补救工作和交纳罚金。
Based on a settlement last week, BP will now pay the largest criminal penalty in US history – $4.5 billion.	根据上周达成的协议，英国石油公司将支付美国历史上最大的一 笔刑事罚款——45亿美元。
The same standards for environmental cleanup need to be applied to global companies operating in poorer countries, where their power has typically been so great relative to that of governments that many act with impunity, wreaking havoc on the environment with little or no accountability.	同样的环境事故清理善后标准也应运用到那些在贫困国家经营的国际企业身上。 这些大公司的势力相对当地政府来说通常极为巨大，以致许多公司都是在豁免权下活动，可以对环境造成严重破坏却极少或无需承担责任。
As we enter a new era of sustainable development, impunity must turn to responsibility.	随着我们进入一个可持续发展的新时代，豁免权应该转向责任制。
Polluters must pay, whether in rich or poor countries.	不管是在富国还是穷国，污染者必须付出代价。
Major companies need to accept responsibility for their actions.	大公司应该为它们的行为承担相应的责任。
Nigeria has been Exhibit A of corporate environmental impunity.	尼日利亚就曾经是企业逍遥于环境污染惩罚之外的例子。
For decades, major oil companies, including Shell, ExxonMobil, and Chevron, have been producing oil in the Niger Delta, an ecologically fragile environment of freshwater swamp forests, mangroves, lowland rainforests, and coastal barrier islands.	几十年来，包括壳牌、埃克森美孚和雪弗龙在内的各大石油公司一直在尼日尔三角洲开采石油。 尼日尔三角洲是一个拥有淡水沼泽森林、红树林、低地雨林和沿海屏障岛屿的脆弱生态环境。
This rich habitat supports remarkable biodiversity – or did before the oil companies got there –&#160;and more than 30 million local inhabitants, who depend on the local ecosystems for their health and livelihoods.	这片肥沃富饶的栖息地支撑着非凡的生物多样性——或者说在石油公司来破坏之前是这样的——而当地3000多万居民的健康和生计都依赖于该生态系统。
Twenty years ago, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources classified the Niger Delta as a region of high biodiversity of marine and coastal flora and fauna – tree species, fish, birds, and mammals, among other forms of life – and therefore rated it as a very high priority for conservation.	二十年前，世界自然保护联盟把尼日尔三角洲分类为一个拥有极丰富海洋及沿海动植物多样性的地区——不同树种、鱼类、鸟类和哺乳类与其他形式的生命共处一地——因此将其列为极高的优先保护等级。
Yet it also noted that the region’s biodiversity was under massive threat, with little or no protection.	然而该联盟也指出，由于这个地区极少或未被保护，其生物多样性正处于巨大的威胁之中。
The global companies operating in the delta have spilled oil and flared natural gas for decades, without regard for the natural environment and the communities impoverished and poisoned by their actions.	在尼日尔三角洲经营的跨国石油企业几十年来一直在该地区泄漏石油及燃烧天然气，根本不考虑自然环境和因其行为而变得贫困甚至遭受毒害的人类社区。
One estimate puts the cumulative spills over the past 50 years at approximately 10 million barrels – twice the size of the BP spill.	一份研究估计宣称过去50年中这些公司累积泄漏的石油约为1000万桶——这是英国石油公司漏油量的2倍。
The data are uncertain: there have been many thousands of spills during this period – often poorly documented and their magnitude hidden or simply unmeasured by either the companies or the government.	该数据并不准确：过去的50年中有好几千次石油溢出事故——通常这些事故都未被详细记录，其石油泄漏量常常被掩盖甚至被公司及政府故意忽略。
Indeed, just as BP was being hit with new criminal penalties, ExxonMobil announced yet another pipeline leak in the Niger Delta.	确实，正当英国石油公司遭受新的刑事处罚时，埃克森美孚又通报了一起位于尼日尔三角洲的石油管道泄漏事件。
The environmental destruction of the delta is part of a larger saga: corrupt companies operating hand in hand with corrupt government officials.	三角洲的环境破坏只是一长串事件中的一部分：腐败的公司与腐败的政府官员相互勾结以牟取私利。
The companies routinely bribe officials to gain oil leases, lie about output, evade taxes, and dodge responsibility for the environmental damage that they cause.	公司通常贿赂政府官员以获取石油合同，它们谎报产量，偷税漏税，逃避由其经营活动引起的环境损害的责任。
Nigerian officials have become fabulously wealthy, owing to decades of payoffs by international companies that have plundered the delta’s natural wealth.	由于一直掠夺三角洲自然财富的跨国企业几十年来的贿赂，尼日利亚的政府官员变得惊人的富有。
Shell, the largest foreign operator in the Niger Delta, has been criticized repeatedly for its egregious practices and its unwillingness to be held to account.	壳牌——尼日尔三角洲最大的国外营运商——就屡次因其恶名昭彰的行为及不愿承担责任的态度而遭到外界批评。
Meanwhile, the local population has remained impoverished and beset by diseases caused by unsafe air, poisoned drinking water, and pollution in the food chain.	与此同时，当地居民却一直处于贫困状态，还被由不安全的空气、被污染的饮用水和食物链污染引起的疾病所困扰。
Local lawlessness has led to gang warfare and persistent illegal tapping into the pipelines to steal oil, leading to further massive oil spills and frequent explosions that kill dozens, including innocent bystanders.	当地违法行为已经引起了黑帮火拼以及层出不穷的管道偷油案件，这又进一步导致了大量石油泄漏事故并导致了造成大量人员死亡——包括许多无辜受殃者——的频繁爆炸事件。
In the colonial era, it was the official purpose of imperial power to extract wealth from the administered territories.	在殖民时期，从殖民领地攫取财富是帝国主义的官方意图。
In the post-colonial period, the methods are better disguised.	而在后殖民时期，这种意图有了更好的伪装。
When oil companies misbehave in Nigeria or elsewhere, they are protected by the power of their home countries.	当石油公司在尼日利亚或其他国家恣意妄为时，它们会受到母国政权保护。
Don’t mess with the companies, they are told by the United States and Europe.	美国及欧洲国家警告那些石油原产国：别找石油公司的麻烦。
Indeed, one of the largest bribes (a reputed $180 million) paid in recent times in Nigeria was by Halliburton, a company tightly intertwined with US political power.	确实，尼日利亚近期最大的一笔贿赂（外界普遍估计约1. 8亿美元）是由美国哈利伯顿公司支付的，而该公司与美国政界则有着错综复杂的关系。
(Dick Cheney went from being Halliburton’s CEO to the US vice presidency.)	（迪克·切尼就是从哈利伯顿的首席执行官摇身一变成为美国副总统的。 ）
Last year, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) issued a remarkable report on Ogoniland, a major ethnic homeland in the Niger Delta that has been at the epicenter of conflict between local communities and international oil.	去年，联合国环境规划署发布了一份引人注目的奥贡尼兰报告，奥贡尼兰是一个曾经曾处于本地社区与跨国石油企业矛盾中心的尼日尔三角洲主要部族祖居地。
The report was as scathing as it was scientifically clear.	这份报告措辞严厉证据清晰。
Despite many past promises of a cleanup, Ogoniland remains in environmental agony, impoverished and sickened by the oil industry.	尽管过去石油公司作过很多关于清理的承诺，奥贡尼兰依旧处于恶劣的环境状况之下，该地区已经被石油产业榨干了财富而且疾病肆虐。
UNEP also offered clear and detailed recommendations, including emergency measures to ensure safe drinking water; cleanup activities targeting the mangroves and soils; public-health studies to identify and counteract the consequences of pollution; and a new regulatory framework.	联合国环境规划署同时还提供了清晰详细的建议，包括保证安全饮用水的紧急措施； 针对红树木和土壤的清除活动；
The world’s governments have recently agreed to move to a new framework for sustainable development, declaring their intention to adopt Sustainable Development Goals at the Rio+20 Summit in June.	世界各国政府在六月的“里约+20峰会”上宣布他们打算采用可持续发展目标，并于近期同意为了可持续发展接受新的监管框架。
The SDGs offer a critical opportunity for the world to set clear, compelling standards for government and corporate behavior.	可持续发展目标为全世界给政府及公司行为设定清晰强制的标准提供了一个关键的机会。
Many major companies, including in the oil industry, have expressed their readiness to support sustainable development goals.	包括石油产业在内的许多大公司都表达了他们支持可持续发展目标的意愿。
Cleaning up the Niger Delta would provide the strongest possible example of a new age of accountability.	清除尼日尔三角洲的石油污染将给新时代的问责制提供一个具备最大实施可能性的例子。
Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and other major oil companies should step forward and help to fund the necessary cleanup, ushering in a new era of responsibility.	壳牌、雪弗龙、埃克森美孚以及其他石油大公司应该站出来资助必要的石油污染清理，开创一个负责任的新时代。
The Nigerian government’s own accountability is on the line as well.	尼日利亚政府本身也有不可推卸的责任。
It is heartening that several Nigerian senators have recently been in the forefront of efforts to strengthen the rule of law in the oil sector.	令人鼓舞的是已经有几位尼日利亚参议员最近一直站在致力加强石油产业法治化的最前沿。
The cleanup of the Niger Delta provides an ideal opportunity for Nigeria, the oil industry, and the international community to show convincingly that a new age has dawned.	尼日尔三角洲的石油清理行动给尼日利亚、石油产业以及国际社会提供了一个理想的机会来向世界昭示——一个新的时代已经到来了。
From now on, sustainable development must not be a mere slogan, but rather an operational approach to global governance and well-being on a strained and crowded planet.	从现在开始，可持续发展不能纯粹只是一个口号，而应该是针对全球治理及在这个浮躁拥挤的星球上谋求幸福的运作方法。
A Centerless Euro Cannot Hold	缺少集中的欧元无法生存
CAMBRIDGE – With youth unemployment touching 50% in eurozone countries such as Spain and Greece, is a generation being sacrificed for the sake of a single currency that encompasses too diverse a group of countries to be sustainable?	美国剑桥—在西班牙和希腊等欧元区国家，年轻人失业率达到了50%，这可以说是为了在覆盖彼此差异太大而根本不可能持续的多国实行单一货币而牺牲了一代人吗？
If so, does enlarging the euro’s membership really serve Europe’s apparent goal of maximizing economic integration without necessarily achieving full political union?	如果答案是肯定的，扩大欧元区成员国范围真的有助于欧洲达到最大化经济一体化而又不必形成政治上的完全统一这一众人皆知的目标吗？
The good news is that economic research does have a few things to say about whether Europe should have a single currency.	好消息是，经济研究确实对欧洲是否应该使用单一货币这一问题形成了一些成果。
The bad news is that it has become increasingly clear that, at least for large countries, currency areas will be highly unstable unless they follow national borders.	坏消息是，越来越明显的是，至少对于大国，货币区是非常不稳定的，除非其边界和国境线相同。
At a minimum, currency unions require a confederation with far more centralized power over taxation and other policies than European leaders envision for the eurozone.	不管怎样，货币联盟至少需要是一个邦联，拥有比欧洲领导人的欧元区愿景远为集中的税收和其他政策权力。
What of Nobel Prize winner Robert Mundell’s famous 1961 conjecture that national and currency borders need not significantly overlap?	那么，如何看待诺贝尔奖获得者蒙代尔1961年的著名预言呢？ 蒙代尔说，国境线和货币边界并不需要大致重合。
In his provocative American Economic Review paper “A Theory of Optimum Currency Areas,” Mundell argued that as long as workers could move within a currency region to where the jobs were, the region could afford to forgo the equilibrating mechanism of exchange-rate adjustment.	在他发表于《美国经济评论》（American Economic Review）的雄文《最优货币区理论》（A Theory of Optimum Currency Areas）中，蒙代尔指出，只要工人能在货币区内自由流动追逐工作，该货币区就可以形成一个汇率调整的均衡机制。
He credited another (future) Nobel Prize winner, James Meade, for having recognized the importance of labor mobility in earlier work, but criticized Meade for interpreting the idea too stringently, especially in the context of Europe’s nascent integration.	蒙代尔将对劳动流动性的重要性的认识归功于另一位（未来）诺贝尔奖获得者米德，但也指出，米德对这一观点的解释太过严格，特别是在欧洲一体化刚刚出现萌芽的时候。
Mundell did not emphasize financial crises, but presumably labor mobility is more important today than ever.	蒙代尔并未强调金融危机，但他推测劳动流动性在今日要比过去更重要。
Not surprisingly, workers are leaving the eurozone’s crisis countries, but not necessarily for its stronger northern region.	毫不奇怪，工人们正在离开欧元区危机国，但迁移目标并非一定是更坚挺的北欧地区。
Instead, Portuguese workers are fleeing to booming former colonies such as Brazil and Macau.	事实上，葡萄牙工人正在逃向繁荣的昔日殖民地，比如巴西和澳门。
Irish workers are leaving in droves to Canada, Australia, and the United States.	爱尔兰工人正在迁往加拿大、澳大利亚和美国。
Spanish workers are streaming into Romania, which until recently had been a major source of agricultural labor in Spain.	西班牙工人正在涌向罗马尼亚，而后者以前一直是西班牙农业劳动力的主要来源。
Still, if intra-eurozone mobility were anything like Mundell’s ideal, today we would not be seeing 25% unemployment in Spain while Germany’s unemployment rate is below 7%.	尽管如此，如果欧元区内部流动性能够与蒙代尔的理想状况略有相似，那么如今我们就不会看到西班牙失业率高达25%而德国失业率低至不到7%的情况。
Later writers came to recognize that there are other essential criteria for a successful currency union, which are difficult to achieve without deep political integration.	后来的研究者开始认识到成功的货币联盟还���要其他关键要素，而这些要素在没有深度政治一体化的情况下很难实现。
Peter Kenen argued in the late 1960’s that without exchange-rate movements as a shock absorber, a currency union requires fiscal transfers as a way to share risk.	柯南（Peter Kenen）在20世纪60年代末指出，如果没有汇率变动作为冲击吸收器，货币联盟就需要财政转移来作为分担风险的办法。
For a normal country, the national income-tax system constitutes a huge automatic stabilizer across regions.	在平常国家，国民所得税嫡系便是一个巨型地区级自动稳定器。
In the US, when oil prices go up, incomes in Texas and Montana rise, which means that these states then contribute more tax revenue to the federal budget, thereby helping out the rest of the country.	在美国，当油价上涨时，德克萨斯州和蒙大拿州的收入会上升，这意味着该两州将向联邦预算贡献更多的税收收入，从而帮助美国的其余地区走出困境。
Europe, of course, has no significant centralized tax authority, so this key automatic stabilizer is essentially absent.	当然，欧洲不存在大型中央税收当局，因此这一重要自动稳定器也就不存在了。
Some European academics tried to argue that there was no need for US-like fiscal transfers, because any desired degree of risk sharing can, in theory, be achieved through financial markets.	一些欧洲学者试图论证像美国那样的财政转移并不是必须的，因为从理论上说，不管你想要多大程度的风险共担，都可以通过金融市场达到。
This claim was hugely misguided.	这一论断大错特错。
Financial markets can be fragile, and they provide little capacity for sharing risk related to labor income, which constitutes the largest part of income in any advanced economy.	金融市场可能非常脆弱，所提供的分担劳动收入相关风险能力几乎为零，而劳动收入是发达国家收入的最大来源。
